__label__2 Sets the stage: House of Cards: In this first installment we are introduced to our main characters as they transverse their separate storylines. Apart from each other we learn their individual strengths as they prove what they are made of and watch as they struggle through dire circumstances sometimes narrowly avoiding death itself.If you are a fan of Star Trek: TNG then you'll be right at home with this series. Even if you are new to the Expanded Universe of Trek I have no doubt that you'll enjoy these books.
__label__2 The New Frontiers of Trek... really new?: The thing to remember about Peter David is that he thrives on recurring characters. Those characters which he has made up before (Stone, "Rock and a Hard Place;" Delcara, "Vendetta;" etc) function by sounding off of the great characterization he gives to the already known cast. That is David's strength and I feel that "New Frontier" is an experimental place for him. Not the great read that "Imzadi" or "Q-Squared" was but better than most Trek novels. Enjoyable read. I agree wit everyone else, however, in saying that Pocket Books should have released the entire thing together instead of this "to be continued" garbage
__label__2 Outstanding: This is the best and most original 'dj mix' album I have heard in many years and I've been listening to electronic music for a long long time. I think James Holden is as good as some of the legends like Andy Weatherall when he was at his best.
__label__2 Buy them, children learn!: I bought the first two DVD's for my 3 year old and 1 year old so they would have familiarization to the language. They loved them! They both go around singing the songs, what a great way to introduce the language to children. Children singing to children! Mei Mei is very animated which is especially inviting to children. I have just ordered Volumes 3 & 4 for Christmas, I can't wait to view them as I am learning too. So easy not to!Do not be put off by Volume 1, the kids love it and the next volume is a better production.
__label__2 Heavy Metal Thunder!: Most of Steppenwolf's best material is contained in this album, which is considerably better than their previous live efforts. John Kay has put together the most proficient (and most stable) Steppenwolf lineup ever, and the superior musicianship shows on every cut. The legendary John is also in fine voice, reaffirming his place in rock history as the man who coined the phrase "heavy metal" and created a whole new rock genre. Well done!
__label__2 OK Basic Book: The Book is more like an introduction to spell making than anything else. It has spells for a variety of situations it is purely of a positive nature, more Wiccan style than anything else. For those looking for a variety of spells from different traditions look for another book. Besides that the book is well put together it has a good intro and good basic nice spells explained carefully and suggesting the best way and time to use them.
__label__2 The Roots: For all of you who think that this is a selection of texts by Levi (a kind of "Primo Levi's Reader" with a fragmentary sample of his work), it is not.This is a selection of texts (literary, scientific, etc) made by Primo Levi among those he believed to be the requiered reading for a humanistic education. Take a look at the Table of Contents and see for yourself.You don't need to have read previously any Levi book in order to enjoy this anthology, which is a masterful collage by a master thinker. It is a joyful read.
__label__2 It's a great idea.: I have a HP 6330 cpu and the DVD portion of the drive is not functioning. I keep getting an error signal and when I look up this error and do what the manual tells me it still does not work. I am going to have to get in touch with Ricoh and find out what I need to do. But, once that glitch is worked out this will be a great addition to my computer.
__label__1 Reviews from other owners appreciated!: I hear a lot of people complaining that the drive simply quits recognizing cds. Some units will only work with Ricoh brand media, etc. others won't play DVDs. We would appreciate reviews from folks who have purchased this unit!
__label__2 Best hiking book for Oahu: i found myself sitting at home on my days off playing computer games or watching tv too much, so i decided to get out and go have some fun!! Dont wanna end up being a couch potato!!i did the web searches for hikes and found a bunch but wanted something i could bring to work and read so...After reading all the review , i picked this book because it always rated as the best book on hiking on Oahu...and it is! It shows almost all the hikes for Oahu, how to get there, what the trails like and a ton of information about how hard or easy, how long and the plants you will see on the hike.i bought a few other books on hiking,Oahu Hikes: The Best Hikes and Walks on the Island (Lone Pine Guide)(lotsa nice pictures but not much info),Day Hikes on Oahu, 3rd57 hikes but each on one page so again, not much information.So, if you want to try your hand errr feet at hiking on Oahu, save yourself some time and money and buy this book!!
__label__2 CELESTINE PROPHECY: WHILE WAITING FOR AUTO REPAIRS, I FOUND A THRIFT SHOP TO BROWSE, AND PICKED UP THIS BOOK FOR A DOLLAR. WHEN I GOT HOME, I READ THE BOOK IN 6 HRS. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!! I JUST LOVED IT! IT WAS AN ADVENTURE, AND IF YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN SPIRITUAL PATH, AND NOT SURE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS YOU EXPERIENCE ALONG THE WAY, THIS BOOK WILL GENTLY GUIDE YOU, AND CONFIRM THAT YOUR EXPERIENCES ARE JUST PERFECTLY NORMAL. I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN AWARE OF MUCH OF THIS FOR YEARS, WITHOUT EVER READING A THING. ENJOY!!
__label__1 Don't buy.: Motor is incredibly noisy. Hard to put cans in the right spot so it will work. When it finishes a cut, it flips the can lid & splashes contents all over. Overall piece of crap.
__label__1 Mmm... Déjà vu (but his theory is cool): This book seems like a repetition of the firs one (Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity) which was very interesting and it helped me a lot. If you want to learn his theory about edit and organize todo list, you better buy that one.
__label__2 Usual excellent quality from DMT, albeit at a price: The price of this two-sided sharpening stone is a bit high, although one should be aware that it has two usable sides unlike other models with just one. I'm happy so far and assume that it will last at least a few decades like my older DMT stone has.
__label__2 I agree, not the best...: which doesn't mean that you shouldn't read it, since even Marsh's books that aren't quite up to the mark are still very good reads. I found the method of murder to be a little too clever for something that was not necessarily premeditated. Everything else, though, characters, motives, weapon, etc. are in perfect order. AND you get to meet the much-featured minor character Nigel Bathgate, the gentleman-journalist who comes closest to what one might call Inpector Alleyn's Watson.
__label__1 Haphazard adlib crap: I cannont understand why this album is being regarded as so great. The songs are crap and sound like they are pieced together from umpteen other bands, and to top it all, they don't make sense. If you are into a band that did its best to keep up with the mainstream rock genre of the 80's but failed, go for Saga.
__label__1 "Last" but not Best: I've been a loyal reader of Martha Grimes books, but this one was a disappointment. There were too many loose ends (and sloppy editing mistakes), too many rambling thoughts, and not enough substance (as much as I tried I couldn't "buy" the motive for the murder of Simon Croft). I also hated the cliffhanger ending (before this book, Grimes wouldn't have had to resort to such tricks to sell the next book).That's not to say there weren't bright spots. As always the literary references were compelling and well-placed, and her well-known and loved Long Pidd characters didn't disappoint.
__label__1 Time to Put Richard Jury to Bed: Martha Grimes is in a pickle. Without a doubt many of her Richard Jury fans won't read her other fiction. But how she is betraying the long-time fans of this series named after pubs with the stale, meandering plotting in "The Blue Last." Suspenseful, this book is not. (Grimes breaks every mystery-writing convention in the book. This used to be all right! Now she's writing like an amateur!) Seems to me it's time for Grimes to put Richard Jury and his oh-so-tiresome friends to bed, inaugurate another series. It will be like a bump in the road, but loyal fans will follow. But Mrs. Grimes, let's drop the sideshow acts and stick to the main plot!
__label__1 The Blue Last: Although I have always enjoyed the Richard Jury series with all the characters and plots, this book was a big disappointment. The plot wandered all over the place, with a side trip to Italy with Melrose and Trueblood which had nothing to do with the mystery. Also, the main mystery was never really explained or solved, characters you cared about were left in limbo, and the ending was absolutely awful, didn't make any sense at all.
__label__1 The last disappointment: I'm a diehard reader of English-based mystery series, and I loved the early Jury novels. I stopped reading when the silly Long Pidd subplots and characters got so much attention. This was my last try with this one. The plot has real potential, but the pacing was lazy and careless.The Trueblood sections went nowhere, and seem to exist to prove the author's sensitivity to beauty. Melrose's involvement seem forced and implausible. The whole effort is blurry and unfocused. Maybe the author is tired of her characters. Carol Ann is now marginal, outdated, a one dimensional character, who does little to advance our understanding of Jury. At the "shocking" end I should have cared. I was only annoyed that I had wasted time.
__label__2 Reference material for Abhidharma enthusiasts: This is an excellent collection of detailed summaries of the earliest Abhidharma works that survived. Not for the casual reader, but a terrific resource for those already well-versed in the fundamental tenets of Buddhism.
__label__1 Awesome Sound; Pitiful Ergonomics: Before purchasing these I had read other reviews with a similar message, and figured my ears could surely sacrifice a bit of comfort for some economically priced accoustics. I was wrong. I can't explain exactly why, but these things are QUITE uncomfortable. Perhaps more padding on the ears would help, or less pressure applied by the adjoining headband. Who knows... Seriously consider another set... Currently I can only wear these for about 10-20 minutes at a time before it becomes so uncomfortable that I have to take a break. I have a nagging suspicion that they're actually cutting off some circulation to my upper neck. Definitely considering returning them for this reason alone.
__label__2 Still lovin' it after 18 months: We've had the Movietime for over a year and still love it. The convenience is great. We don't have a seperate AV room and we don't want to set up a bunch of audio video gear in our living room, so when we want to watch videos we just plop down the Optoma and point it a the wall. Huge image, excellent color and sharpness. The sound is adequate. For us it's the perfect solution and well worth the dough.
__label__2 This is a wonderful timeless film to watch again and again.: This is one of my favorite movies of all time! If there is ever a play featuring this story - I am sure to tryout! This is a must have for any video library.
__label__2 Great movie for everyone: This movie is known as a bike movie, but it's really a movie about growing up and leaving home. It has funny dialogue, good acting and a good plot.
__label__2 Neiman Marcus Cookbook: Excellent! Ordered book especially for the Tortilla soup recipe, and it delivered a delicious, not too spicy hot soup with garnish of tortilla strips and sour cream. Instead of donuts, our Christmas family enjoyed the "tortilla soup"for brunch.
__label__2 DON`T BE SCARED OFF BY THE MOVIE!: Ok,this book was really good,but the movie sucked.BIG TIME!I read the book first and had high expectations about the movie.Well,appearently not.It was really bad. With such a good book at hand,they were still able to creat a very mediocre movie. So don't watch the movie, read the book! You won't regret it.
__label__2 Ancient curses: Have read good reviews about the Pendergast series, so decided to dive in with the first book, and found it a thrilling ride indeed. Reminded me a bit of Crichton's early work. Every time I see an exhibit in a museum, anywhere in the world, I am reminded of how much of the stuff was stolen and/or plundered. How can displaying mummies be anything other than grave-robbery? And yet, I appreciate the privilege that museums afford me. This story is about the "curse" of moving things to places they do not belong.
__label__2 Taunt, exciting thriller: After the death of two museum visitors, the museum of Natural History calls in the Police, headed by truculent hard-nosed Lt. D'Agosta, also FBI Agent Pendergast, a quirky and unorthodox investigator from the south. What they discover? They believe a serial killer is on the loose- perhaps intending to derail the museum's new "Superstition" exhibit. What they don't know is something far more sinister lives in the basement of the museum. As the date of the exhibit nears, can the agents and a team of museum scientists get to the bottom of the museum murders before its too late?I listened to the unabridged audio edition of Relic. The characters were well thought out, the monster interesting and the story exciting. I particularly liked D'Agosta and Dr. Frock. The monster itself was fascinating, and the museum was very cool as the background for this taunt story.5 stars. Excellent.
__label__2 Suspenseful Entertainment: This was my first Douglas Preston/Lincoln Child book and I really enjoyed it. The story was extremely suspenseful and highly entertaining and not hard to read. I am looking forward to reading the sequel Reliquary and also I heard great things about Riptide also by the same authors.The only thing I don't understand about Relic (and I may have just missed this while reading the book) is how exactly did the monster get into the museum in the first place? That was somehow never clear to me since the museum beast had apparently gone on a killing spree while on the ship near New Orleans. Did it go back into one of the crates and keep quiet until it got into the museum?Aside from that, this was a fantastic book and I recommend it highly. I especially liked Agent Pendergast who I thought was an intriguing character.BlueLotus
__label__2 Wow! What an exciting book!: What a thrilling mystery! I really enjoyed this book and I am just so excited that this is a whole new series to be read! It is always just so exciting to find a new mystery series! I am not at all surprised that this was made into a movie. I am very curious to see this movie and see how they translated this book onto the silver screen. I am looking forward to seeing it, as well as to reading the sequel!
__label__1 ok 2 1/2 stars: read only if desparate. im giving it more than 1 star purely due to the chapter 63, or the epilogue if you must. i found that the book dragged on too much and was relieved when i finally finished it [i would have stopped reading if i could but i just cant not finish a book]. the ending sort of made the whole ordeal worth while - i actually gasped and almost dropped my coffee when i read it. if you cant be bothered reading the whole goddamn book just read chapters 1, 3, 4, 14, 62 and 63. i lost interest often and found myself having to read the same sentence/page over and over sometimes because it wasnt catching if you know what i mean. just bored me and made me anxious to finish it. the characters didnt really do anything for me either. maybe if it were written by different people/person, it may be worthwhile but do yourself a favour and read something else. i suggest the da vinci code or deception point, both by dan brown. hope i helped you.
__label__2 Experience neccessary in order to fully appreciate book: Overall, the book was a delight to read. However, I will admit that the more experience that one has with topics discussed in the book, the more likely one will believe that "The Interruption of Everything" is a good book. If one lacks experience with some of the subject matter, the book will seem less appealing. Topics include but are not limited to; being married with children, lacking appreciation from family members and friends, caring for aging parents with mental health issues, unfulfilled dreams and desires etc...).Terry is still a literary genius and she does a good job making the characters seem realistic. However, this book is not better than "A Day Late and A Dollar Short". Nonetheless, I would recommend it to others.
__label__1 This one just didnt do it for me.: I really could not get into this book, I started it but could not finish it as well.Thank God I borrowed it from the library!!!
__label__1 Disapointed in Terry: I felt bored through most of this book. I kept waiting for it to get better because after all, it is Terry McMillan! It was just one problem after another for Marilyn with no relief in sight. Then after all she went through and complained about she stayed with her bonehead husband and took on her sister's children! So what really changed in her life? Nothing. I read this whole book for nothing.I had to ask myself - is Terry losing her touch?
__label__1 BORING: I expected so much more from Terry. This book was too boring for words! Don't waste your money. She is too talented to put something like this out there.
__label__1 A Disappointment: I don't know who said this was a pageturner, because it is not. The first chapter was complicated and made me not want to continue to read, but because it's Terry McMillan, I continued. I didn't care for the way the book was written. It's not like her other books. This one, by far is the worse. Mama is her best work and Day Late, Dollar Short, is following closely beind that one. I was so tempted to buy this book because I was on the waiting list at the library for more than two months and I am so glad I did not purchase it. It was a struggle to just finish it. I'll probably read her next book because I'm sure it'll have something to do with deception and divorce about her husband's homosexuality. But there has already been a book written about that called "Grown Folks Business," which I intend to read. But knowing Terry, she'll put hot sauce in her words to make it more spicy.
__label__1 Boring: I have picked this book up many times over the past month and I am only on page 62. I have read all of Terry's books and enjoyed each and everyone. I just cannot seem to get into this one.
__label__2 Tried and very true: Saxon have been a much maligned band in some quarters for years. I can not see the problem. Call it traditional, power metal, call it what you like, this is good solid heavy metal music, the music this band has been making and I have been listening to for longer than I care to remember. The only personnel change from recent years is the loss of drummer Fritz Randow, replaced with Jorg Michael. It is a seamless transition. The typical Saxon guitar sound is here, and Biff just sounds as good as ever. Saxon continues their tradition of strong albums with the exception of that period between Crusader and Solid Ball of Rock that we don't talk about. Do yourself a favour and get this album, it will not let you down.
__label__2 ...: Places I Never Meant To Be is a collection of short stories written by censored writers accompanied by each writer's personal experience with censorship. While the stories are mostly good, some of them are a little 2 dimensional simply because they didn't have enough time to develop their characters and/or situations.I personally enjoyed the commentary more than the stories simply because it introduced me to an issue that I knew very little about. I was a little ashamed when my own hometown was mentioned as being a place where ludicrous censorship has taken place.If you're not much for short stories, you might do well to simply read the introduction and each author's point of view. If you are, then you will probably enjoy this book.
__label__2 eclectic: This cd is a great album in its entirity. From begining to end it keeps you listening wondering what he will do next reggae or rap will he do a folk song or just some pop sounding song. The man of taste. You got to check it out if you enjoy rap & R&b with rock mixed together
__label__1 Master of nothing: Headphone masterpiece? Maybe for the deaf. Ches-nut can barely play guitar, and his lyrics only serve to illustrate how unintelligent and immature he really is. But then again, we live in a world where so much [garbage] passes as music. This is in the same category as every third rate one-hit wonder that has aired on MTV over the past decade. American idol will last longer than this.
__label__2 Can't Get No Betta: and I fear Cody probably won't... was truly gifted and inspired, can't help but feel he'll never reach this high again. He refused to perform any songs that might contradict his new spirituality ...even censored himself on "Look Good in Leather" and "The Seed" and pretty much preached about his faith in God the whole night.That being said, this album is truly inspired and while a bit raunchy at times, feels very personal and comes from some place most folks can't tap into, mixing a lot of soul and angst. The angst might be gone going forward, though, as it doesn't seem to agree with Cody's God. Loved the show, but it sure wasn't what I was expecting.
__label__1 Don't Bother If You Like Baseball: For a baseball fan, this book is awful, almost painful. It's pretty clear the author doesn't really understand baseball. The book is full of obvious errors. For example (from page 69):"Scott Maloney, pumped up for the battle, came straight out and whacked a double off Fisher's second fastball, straight into the left-center gap. Ray Sweeney came up and took the first pitch, an inside fastball he banged right between the first and second baseman. This put runners and first and second."Okay, a double followed by a single puts runners at first and second? A single on a pitch the batter "took"? Not only is the author clueless, but apparently no one bothered to employ an editor.Not all of the baseball-related errors are this awful, but most of the baseball narrative has minor flaws, inconsistencies, and just doesn't sound right. I gave up after about a hundred pages, but according to other reviews the book gets worse as it goes along.DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS BOOK!!
__label__2 An incredible adventure: It's an incredible way to share Alice's original adventure with your kids. It's amazingly well made and creative. The whole family loved it!
__label__2 +++++++ Pop UP Master++++++: I love this wonderful portrayal of Alice's adventures in the form of pop-up art. Sabuda's Pop-ups are a constantly source of amazement for my sister. We are full of admiration for the skill and intricate detail that goes into creating these masterpieces. I got this book last Christmas together with Sabuda's pop-up "Encyclopedia Prehistorica" and Nowiki's short storyWhy Some Cats are Rascals, Book 2- a charming story with a lot of information about from the world of felines.
__label__2 MY LITTLE ALICE: We just finished with the production of Alice in Wonderland and I bought this for the three Alice's that performed in this role...They LOVED it!!! It was a hit with all the children as well as the adults. Beautiful illustrations!!Linette Welshinger
__label__2 Alice'sAdventures: This is an absolutely beautiful book. I think any child would be totally enthralled with it.
__label__1 not worth the money: i've seen the same style cutters on ebay for much less. Its not worth paying this much for a machine thats made in china. Look on Ebay, you can find some for way cheaper, just with a different name.
__label__1 not so filter filter: looked really bad for a filter, putting a napkin inside the frame would have been better. but u get what u pay for.
__label__1 brother once again...: Hi we purchased this machine (brother Intellyfax 2820) 14 months ago. In month 5 we started to hear a very annoying squeaky noise come out of our fax machine when printing. After 5 months of use we found out that it needed a drum replacement if wanted to preserve the sanity of our ears. At first we thought we will have to spend 10 o 15 bucks on this new part. To our surprise a drum costs $ 115 bucks !. Well, that is not all, we just found out that our fax machine displays the message "Toner Life End". Went to the store and purchased a $60 brand new original toner and put it back to the machine. Well, it keeps showing the same message. We called Brother and we are SOL because our warranty expired 2 months ago. Went online and realized that a bunch of other people have the same problem.. ohh God... that is it for me with the Brother family...
__label__2 Unobtrusive but not "hidden": I want to use this to house a hidden security camera and battery on a remote site to catch vandals and tresspassers until we build. It's a little translucent and doesn't match the limestone-like rock at the site. And I'll have to hide the stake lugs. Some transparent or tan silicone caulk and a pound of rock dust should fix it. Otherwise, it is small enough to be unobtrusive and still house a big battery.
__label__2 The important things in life: This is a simple story in which a girl named Tara finds out what's really important.She starts by believing that what matters is to impress her perfectionist parents by putting on the perfect play on drama night.This thought soon changes when her favourite teacher gets fired due to budget cuts, and Tara realises that saving her teacher's job is more important than all the plays in the world!
__label__2 At Long Last!: I've been looking for this CD for awhile. Once again I found what I needed on Amazon! Paul Kimble is a multi-talented genius! This should have received more wide spread play and promotion. If you've not heard it I recommend you give it a listen and enjoy!
__label__1 BORING: Since I found this book in the bargain bin for $4.98, it should have come as no surprised what a stinker it turned out to be. There wasn't one likable character in the entire thing, other than perhaps Etta. Even March, the main character, was so judgmental and whiny, it was hard to route for her. Like the other reviewers, I found the daughter Olivia to be a ridiculous, over the top character. Who acts like that? Maybe a younger teen, just going through puberty would be at that "I hate my mom" stage. But if a college age girl still treated her mother with that much contempt, then yes March, you must have done something wrong in the way you raised her. The entire book was just a description of March, going through the motions of her rather mundane life. I half expected the author to describe her using the toilet or shaving her legs. I read to escape or be entertained, neither of which happened during this aggravating snooze-fest of a novel.
__label__2 Easy to find...online: When my rabbit was a baby I found this food at Petco, Petsmart and even Target and Walmart. Little by little they all stopped carrying so when I would find it, I'd buy 4 or 5 at a time. Now they have substituted it for cheaper brands (made in China) which stay on the shelf and don't sell and I know this for a fact. Seems to me if something is selling well, why get rid of it. That being said, the price did go up quite a bit in these stores for a 4lb bag and that may have something to do with it. My rabbit is a picky eater and she notices when she doesn't have her brand food and she rather eat plastic, literally, then touch her food. So now I have a spoiled rabbit who'll only eat this as part of her regular diet. She gets fresh grass, fruits and veggies too but she loves her Hartz.
__label__1 NOT healthy for guinea pigs!: I used Hartz brand food when I had hamsters, and it was great. Hartz knows how to manufacture quality foods for SOME rodents. However, many people are not aware of the specifics of guinea pigs' diet, and mistakenly think that Hartz food is okay for them.Shame on Hartz for selling this product specifically for guinea pigs, because this is not what pigs ought to be eating, and they ought to know better. As my vet put it, pigs technically can eat the seeds and artificially colored cereal bits in this mixture, but it's a lot like feeding a human Twinkies 24/7. Guinea pigs are not built to digest seeds, in particular, and there is risk of digestive problems, which can be very serious issue.Buy a simple, quality pellet from Oxbow or Nutriphase for your piggies, and stick to hamsters and gerbils if you're going to buy Hartz.
__label__1 I Don't Get It: I bought this compact disc for the lovely cover of 'Across The Universe". Other than this one track, there is nothing I would listen to again. Unless you are a Beatles completist, save your money.
__label__2 Generally a Good Book; Great Thought Starter: A great book for those just starting on the gay dating scene, or for those who haven't been having much luck. This book guides you from A-Z on how to date, how to avoid many of the pitfalls that gay men face while dating, and how to make a relationship last. My only major disagreement is that the author states that most gay men go through a 'slut stage' before they are ready to settle for love. This may be true for a large number of gay men, but I know many others that wait for love to have sex. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good general guide to dating other men.
__label__1 I wasnt impressed: Ron White is a great comedian, but this album does not do him justice. Before buying this cd I had already heard most of the tracks just by listening to his shows on Comedy Central and the Bob and Tom show. He just isnt as funny with out seeing him. I was really disappointed with this cd. Most of it is just the crowd laughing which makes it really hard to hear him at points in the cd. Personaly I think $13 dollars can buy better things than this cd.
__label__2 "I Want To Be Drunk In A Bar!!!": Ron White's CD Drunk In Public is one of the funniest comedy CDs I've ever heard! I love it when he talks about the Sear "Tire Guy" forgetting to put his lug nuts back on and now he's going to sue Sears. He plans to own the Sears Tower and rename it Ron White's Big F***ing Building! It cracks me up!! This album deserves a 9 out of 10 and I definitely recommend it to anyone! Hilarious!
__label__1 HUGE FAN!!!: I'm a HUGE fan of Ron White, but don't waste your money! I pre-ordered this because I was so excited about a new video. I watched it immediately and was so disappointed. He was so laid back I almost fell asleep, I kept waiting for him to get into his groove but it never happened. I really feel like this video was quickly made only to make Ron White more money. His last joke was an OLD JOKE that wasn't his funniest joke either. Big disappointment and I hope someone from his staff reads this review and gets Ron off his duff and make a video with NEW and FUNNY stuff. We all know he can do it ~ so let us have it.
__label__1 review: The motion-sensor does not work; you have to press the button.The face does not turn around to face you unless you turn it by hand.
__label__1 Doesn't work: Not much of a review here. I will just stick to the basics. It sucks, doesn't work. Don't buy this even if the price seems right.
__label__1 Worked fine, then died: This hub worked fine for over a year, and then stopped working completely (lights don't go on).
__label__1 Too strong for my door: Opening resistance on this item is too strong. I did not install it for fear that it would damage my door. I had to to purchase another (adjustable) model at my local big box store.
__label__1 Useless "reprint": This particular reprint is unusable. A certain amount of marginalia, and even some smudged/ambiguous symbols are to be expected, but this is beyond anything I've seen. Virtually every series of equations has at least some crucial part of it completely whited-out, and on some pages it is clear that several centimeters were cropped off of the outside edge, leaving whole columns of text out.The problem doesn't seem to be the source material, either, as can be seen by comparing the "preview" with the actual book - symbols that are clear in the preview are totally blank in the book (eg bottom of page 21).Planck's book itself is a treasure; but this version just isn't usable. I've had problems with "Forgotten Books" before, and will be more careful to avoid them in the future.Amazon was good enough to give an instant refund (less shipping), provided I print some labels and drop it off. Don't make the same mistake -- try a different print.
__label__1 Product is good, dealer was bad: The Interceptor for Acura is a great product but the vender I used had the worst communication possible. I recieved my product as it was advertised and found out I had a different model car for the product. I then went to send the product back to dealerstore.com and it has been over 3 weeks of poor communication. After contacting dealerstore.com with the error in my purchase, they promised me a return slip within 3 days. I finally got the return slip after 2.5 weeks of phone calls and convincing the company I did not want the product because I ordered the wrong model. After I have put the product back in the mail, It has been a month long process. I recommend the product but I don't recommend using dealerstore.com
__label__1 Piece of junk!: I purchased a pair of LB Evans Duke Opera slippers and wore them only inside on carpeted floors. Within six weeks after purchase, the heels of both slippers were totally frayed. In addition, the rear seam has separated.I then contacted the LB Evans company directly, and they essentially said "too bad!"I've paid $10 for slippers that lasted 3-4 years. I certainly had no idea that in spending over 4 times as much that I would be lucky to see even 4 MONTHS of use.A LOUSY product from a company who won't back up their claims!
__label__2 Brilliant: I brought this DVD because the show has disapeared from the tv and my son always loved it. We have almost worn out the discs already. Very good value for the money. Shame the rest of the shows are not available in the US format. I like these shows because they inspire interaction, copying and imagination. Even my 12 year old will sit with her brother and watch it.
__label__1 What a shame: I entirely enjoyed Gothic and Gothic 2. Gothic 3 does not follow in the footsteps of these games. The interface is worse the story is worse, it is overall a big step backwards. It is a shame to ruin a series as good as Gothic but that is what they have done, much as the new Star Wars movies have ruined that series. If you are a Gothic fan then wait until the price drops way down and then go ahead and buy Gothic 3. If you have have not played any of the Gothic games do not start with this one.Additionally, the game really is buggy. As other reviews have mentioned the game will freeze up from time to time and then there is always the random animal attacks through solid objects (walls and the like).
__label__1 Terrible 3: Gothic 3 is Aspyr's failed attempt to create something like Bethesda Softworks' Elder Scrolls III, Morrowind. EPIC FAIL! Instead they created a clunky resource hog that makes something that should be fun incredibly aggravating. I was running the game on an older PC that was capable of running Bethesda Softworks' Oblivion. The result, Gothic 3 ran like a Yugo on one good cylinder (a sign of poor coding). Moreover, its characters are dull and uninspired (even its introduction scenes are bland). Aspyr should have never released this monstrosity.Bottom line: Gothic 3 is a waste of my money. I am sorry I purchased it. Aspyr has proven to be a poser. If you are interested in open-ended fantasy adventure, go with Bethesda Softworks' Elder Scrolls III, Morrowind or Oblivion.
__label__2 Classic RPG: As noted by my colleagues, with the patches, (I'm using 1.5) Gothic 3 is a great CRPG, in the classic 3rd party tradition. This third installment is a must for those who have enjoyed the earlier versions.
__label__1 Disappointed: Did this workout this morning, all 3 sections. I'm 20 weeks pregnant, and beginning to find every ab exercise difficult. However, I didn't feel a thing with this workout! There simply wasn't enough of any exercise to get a burn of any kind. I was hoping that the standing abs workout would be good for me as I progress through the pregnancy, but I think I'm better off just doing knee lifts on the box, I feel that more!
__label__1 the firm Core Solutions: This c.d. has 3- 10 minute work-outs. The first 2 are so easy that I did not feel any soreness. I did start to feel something on the 3rd work-out. I wouldn't recommend it. A waste of money. I was hoping for a good hard workout. This certainly was a disappointment.
__label__1 I did not like this DVD: I was very disappointed in this DVD. I feel like I wasted the precious 45 minutes I had set aside to really get a great workout. Most of the exercises had 8 counts total. That's barely enough to get proper form or allow a few seconds to follow the tape. I did not find it challenging. I am an intermediate level exerciser. I have used other Firm tapes over the years and found this one did not measure up. I don't even recommend it for beginners because it switched too quickly to follow. I give it a thumbs down.
__label__1 What a rip off!: I was in shock when I got this book!! I paid $10 for this puney little booklet. It's work about $3....THEN today I notice that they are charging $3.99...more like it. I would have NEVER ordered this book if I knew that it was a stupid little booklet. What a rip off! Very disappointed!
__label__2 Romantic Times Library Series are all good!: This is a hot romance - Kane was a most demanding man-and what Kane demanded, he got! Until he came up against Ellen, who had a will to match his. The problem was that Ellen's struggling little Company was under contract to provide Kane with everything he wanted! How could Ellen maintain her reputation-to say nothing of her Company-when even a glance from Kane was enough to make her want to throw herself into his arms? All logic was against it. But logic had nothing to do with what Ellen felt every time he looked at her, touched her, or whispered the words she was on fire to hear from his eager lips.
__label__1 Good content, poor binding.: The content of this book was exactly what I needed for my biblical archaeology class. BUT, the binding broke on my book before I ever finished reading it. The glue is very poor.
__label__2 very cute.: well worth the purchase. please with looks and quality. The beads are a bit rough on the skin so if you have sensitive skin this may not be the purchase for you.
__label__1 Liar: At the time this book was written, Frank Hargrove may have been associated with Shorin Ryu Shorinkan under Shugoro Nakazato, but he was ultimately kicked out of the association and continues to claim to be associated. He has formed "NASKA," and tries to make it look like everyone else was kicked out, not him. He is a very strange man who let his belt color go to his head. Do yourself a favor and save your money for a real Karate master's book. What a disgrace to Shorin Ryu Shorinkan, which is an association about Humility, Respect, and Self-Improvement.
__label__1 Repetitive, boring: Too long, too repetitive and almost no dialogue creates an extended agony that sometimes might be confusing.
__label__2 Messages and Prayers of hope and peace: Its very simple, a wonderful enlightenment to prayers and peace. Read one everyday .. Peace... Love...Light (Nicole..Author of Rainy Day Poems and more 1 and 2.. NY)
__label__1 Smells terrible: I bought this for myself because I'm a poto phan girl and it smelled like it was a stale dollar store perfume ugh I'm only keeping It because it says phantom that's it. It smells terrible
__label__1 5 Great Months - RIP: This is a great product as long as you backup your data WEEKLY (or more often). I became a little comfortable and lazy and didn't backup for 6 weeks and lost any new data when the drive suddenly, after 5 months just stopped working. Reviewing online it seems to be fairly common experience - 3 months to 1 year drive failure.
__label__2 A Change Of Pace: Wow, this CD is really really good. I didn't expect much considering it was their first CD and they were relatively unknown but this CD sounds like it was amazingly planned and well executed.The songs are heartfelt but kinda intense at the same time. It really blends together well. One of the great things about this cd is how the songs varry, they are all different. Lastly I have no idea what in the world people are saying when comparing Loose Lips Sink Ships to Thursday's Cross Out The Eyes, the two songs have very little in common. Highlights to this CD are, Death Do Us Part, December, Every Second and Chippie.
__label__1 Nothing new: I bought this C.D. on the suggestion of a store clerkIt's just okay; with a few good momentsAnd that's all it can ever aspire to beThe first song does rip the guitar intro to "Cross Out The Eyes" by Thursday, and it dosen't go in any big direction after thatMy suggestion, go listen to ThursdayOr Underoath, Taking Back Sunday, Chiodos, Circa Survive, Say Anything, Saves The Day, or Fall Out BoyAll bands that actually mean something or have good ideas
__label__2 Another Great Sabuda Book: The pop-ups in this Katharine Lee Bates book are awesome, as usual with Robert Sabuda's work. This book is beautifully done. It is fascinating as well as educational. I recommend it for both adults and children.
__label__2 The Final Quest: This book is awesome. Encouraging for Christians.I'd think terrifying for non-Christians. It'sa true picture of the way things are.
__label__2 A must read: Every Follower of Christ should read this book, it will give the reader a new perspective on humility. Thank you Holy spirit, for using your son Rick Joyner.
__label__2 Nice Design: As opposed to those "space age" looking humidifyers sold everywhere, this one has a more substantial design and appeal. Featuring two water tanks and filters, this is a unit that will put out some serious moisture. The digital settings for fan speed and moisture content are nice. One more speed between the 4 speeds given would have been just right. Speed two seems too slow and speed three seems a little fast for a bedroom location. Top speed is too noisy for a sleeping or living area, but this puts out plenty of moisture and it is very unlikely that you will want the top speed setting.Quality looks good. Has a decent footprint to avoid easy knockovers. Tanks are easy to fill in any bathroom sink.The design appeal alone is worth the money. Who wants one of those space age looking aquariums sticking out like a sore thumb.
__label__1 As a veteran of the Gulf War, Somalia and Bosnia.....: After the fall of the Berlin Wall, my service has been as fast, furious and jumpy as Hackworth's book Hazardous Duty. Bottom line: I never sensed that he stayed around any one of these three conflicts I served in long enough to get a true appreciation of place (especially Bosnia).A interesting book, but I found the quality of writing was lacking. I felt his observations were many times not grounded in fact, in my humble opinion.I was particularly disappointed with his chapters on the Balkans. I felt like I was watching a cheap horror movie aimed to get the easy scare, then move on to the next one. But heh, who can claim to be an expert, apologies to Rebecca West.Kudos to him on his chapters on Somalia. Not being based in Mogudishu, I found them insightful.
__label__2 Take note of the sides: I like the bag and it seems sturdy. It's what I wanted. The only thing I worry about is rain getting through the top sides. When you have the bag full, the flap covers the main pocket completely, but when you just have a thin notebook in the bag, the sides (where the straps are attached) poke out leaving small uncovered gaps. I really don't know if this will be a problem or not, as I haven't run through the rain with it yet. Also when the bag is relatively empty, the velcro doesn't line up. Yet, both things said, I still like it.
__label__1 Okay for cats, maybe, but not dogs: Previous reviews regarding flimsy construction are accurate. The minuscule "compartments" on top of the roof can't hold more than a single dog biscuit or two, max, and the lids arrived broken and unusable anyway. Construction quality screams "China." The included "food and water travel dish" can't hold more than half a dozen pieces of kibble and a few drops of water...a joke, really, and completely useless. I bought the "medium/large" size for a medium size (15 lb.) dog (small beagle) and found it is far too small for a dog, even of that size. Cats, maybe, but not dogs, no way. I'll now be returning this or trying to resell it to a cat owner at a discount.
__label__2 Good for guinea pigs: I have been using this pet carrier to take my two guinea pigs when I need to take them somewhere by car. It is very strong and sturdy and a seatbelt wraps securely around it. There are small storage compartments on the top and a little plastic dish for food, but I don't use those.
__label__2 Great little carrier for small cat: I'm glad I didn't pay too much attention to some of the reviews which complained about the plastic closures being flimsy. If you were to repeatedly take the carrier apart and keep putting it back together again, then I could see that the clips might eventually weaken and break, but if you just put it together once and leave it that way, as I do, then they seem as sturdy as anything. The 2-prong door latch is SO easy for a human to open, but impossible for a pet to do. It was a breeze to put together, and the 2 little storage compartments on top will probably come in handy. Altogether, I am very pleased with this purchase! (Though I can't understand why the pink one costs about $6. more than the blue one!)
__label__1 Close, but no Cigar: The Harmony 520 is a great idea. But unfortunately falls short. Here are some problems.1. Is unable to power on my Sony CD player. While it can control it once Ive turned it on, it would be nice for me not to have to walk across the room to power it on and off. That is the point of the remote after all. Also, if I am listening to a cd and want to switch to DVD player, the remote does not power off my cd player. The cd player keeps playing and the remote simply changes the input on my receiver.2. Same problem with my X-box 360. Only this time not only does it not turn it on and off, but the remote is unable to control any of the functions of the X-box.The idea of an integrated remote is great. Hopefully Logitech will design a model that works.
__label__2 Terrific book!: This was a terrific book! I like how you got to see Ashleigh in the spotlight for some chapters... not Christina. {Personaly, I think they should have writen more books on Ashleigh.} I thought they should have brought back all the characters of the books before. The author did that... sorta. But this book is a "must get". I bought it when it first came out and read it in about 2 days. I really hope Sammy, Cindy, and Ashleigh get some more books in; even if the books are numbered in the 50's or higher. they should make a Super Edition of something where there are all the OLD characters. This book was really great, though! You got to hear from Cindy and Ben, Sammy and Tor, Parker and "his new girlfriend" and everyone else!...
__label__1 Knock-off , not name brand!: I want to say first that I LOVE Melissa and Doug products. They are very durable and grow with my son developmentally. My problem with this product is that what I received was very clearly NOT a Melissa and Doug puzzle. It very much resembled one until I picked up the puzzle pieces and discovered that they were nothing more than raw wood cut-outs w/ stickers on top! There was not one drop of paint on the pieces! The board was nicely painted and has the Melissa & Doug 'logo' on it like the others that I have, so I am not sure at all what went wrong w/ the pieces.
__label__1 Cheap in price and quality: This looks nice and I was exited when it arrived. However, the pieces look like particle board and the animal stickers come off too easily. It's almost like the picture just melts off. Compared to other toys, this puzzle just doesn't hold up to regular use by a toddler. My daughter is not overly hard on her toys. All my Plan Toys still look great, sadly, not Melissa and Doug. Save your money.
__label__2 Great Game: This is a great game for hard core gamers and for rookies. It's fairly easy to figure out and one feature that is very nice is the ability to run from a battle.
__label__1 Does not hold a charge long...: We are disappointed in this light as it does not last very long on a single charge. Husband's job requires a steady use of a flashlight so dependability is must. We are very satisfied with another Dorcy rechargeable LED flashlight, but this one fails the mark for us.
__label__1 Very Poor Quality spotlight: Very long charge time (many hours) with very small light time (few minutes) Spend your money on a light made anywhere but China ....................... Will never buy another Dorcy light. What a waste of $20.00
__label__2 Must have for travel w/babies and toddlers!: My 22 mo. old did great in this while visiting many different family members' houses. It truly fits many chairs and is secure (and he's active)! Easy to wash. I plan to buy another one for other toddlers who visit here and won't sit down!
__label__1 Okay if your kid doesn't mind being hidden: Technically this harness seems to work okay. It fits chairs and keeps the kid in place. But my daughter ended up sitting so low compared to the table that she didn't like it. It would work best if you happened to have a chair that was unusually high for your table.
__label__2 One of the best clinical books I have ever read!!!: This is one of the best books I have read in Trigger Point Therapy. It includes color illustrations and pictures for each technique described. I found very helpful the home exercises and I use the pictures to explain to my patients what they should do. The literature and research section is well written and easy to understand. I would recommend this book for everyone interested to learn or learn more about myofascial dysfunction.
__label__1 This is not romantic, nor is it a comedy: I have a very hard time believing much of what has been said in the reviews about this dumb movie. It is not romantic. It is not funny. I didn't laugh once. Eight people make a mess of their lives, screwing each other over and not being able to tell the difference between love and lust. Alan, Jon Tenney's character, is an ass. Saffron Burrows character, Zoey, is a sociopath. I can't believe this is described as "a hilarious comedy." Really? Name one funny scene or line. I dare you!
__label__2 APC PRO8 SurgeArrest: I own four of these unit. Three days before Christmas I had a neutral to ground power surge from the pole to my house, it was like a light show going on. The surge fried my brand new oven,garage door opener, parts of the furnace and two of these units. The total damage was about $2000 which my homeowners covered. My computers and TV's were fine because of these units. In front of my desktop computer was one of these then an APC Line-R 1200 voltage regulator connected to an APC PRO 1500 Battery Backup. In front of one of my TV's was another PRO8 then a Line-R and in front of another TV and laptop was just a PRO8.Two of these PRO8's took direct hits like lightning coming in and they fried, it went no further and they saved the insurance company quite a lot of money in electronic equipment. I highly recommend these units and the insurance company even paid for the replacements of them.
__label__2 Fop Computer Surge Protector: APC is the best in the field. Every piece of electronic equipment needs to be protected against voltage surges. You'll never know when this surge protector "just paid for itself". Beware of some claims by others as to their surge protector really working under all conditions.
__label__1 DON'T BUY THIS BOOK: The book is horribly written. It has poor explanations of basic mechanical actions, let alone concepts. It is a waste of money. Microsoft's own study guide is far superior. The material is disjointed and incomplete. It's just a rotten, rotten book.
__label__1 Simply awful: This book is adequate if you are a beginner looking to learn a few new facts, but it has no business claiming that it can be used as a tool for the exam. I have used Sybex books for 6 exams now and this one is by far the worst of the lot. I don't mind typos and other oddities, but the material in this book is WAY to basic and brief to give you what you need to pass the exam. Save your money to buy a transcender and\or the Coriolis Exam Cram book if you want to pass the exam - buy this one if you want an easy read and are unconcerned about the exam itself.
__label__1 poor product: This sucks! Don't get it and let me save you the money...if you want to learn the songs here (the complete songs) purchase juan serranos flamenco book 1...However I do recommend Guitar Method Books 1-3 by Hal Leonard...for any style. I give this software one star because I'm nice
__label__2 Great extra light: I love this litle lamp - I use it in my vacation home & it gives off just enough light...& I can move it around where I need it.
__label__1 disappointing: Ordered two of these lamps for my daughter's reading corner as a Christmas gift. Neither worked. Sending back today. Very disappointing.
__label__1 Very flimsy: Once you put batteries in, you can't carry it by the little handle. It is made of cheap plastic & the handle just falls out. OK as table lamp in power outage but too flimsy for outdoor use. Seems bright enough though.
__label__2 Beautiful Little Book!: Very uplifting and encouraging. Perfect size to give as a gift, keep in purse, etc. I've given many of these out to friends and family. Includes prayers to read aloud. Will bless you as you fix your eyes on HIM! :)
__label__2 Some wild pics in here: I LOVED the pic in the book where the HA was riding bitch with an OL!! I never knew they were that close. Great book, just wish they had captions or stories with the pics.
__label__1 Not what it says: This is a book of the outlaw motorcycle club. I bought it for it said 1% so I thought it would have pictures in it of all the 1% clubs but it only has pictures of the outlaws club only. it is only pictures of the club on a run and with there ladies.a this is only a picture book there are no descriptions of the pictures but the picture quality is quite good most of the pictures are self explanatory
__label__2 Lots of Detail, but explained in everyday language: This book breaks down the biological and chemical reactions that allow caffeine and alcohol to affect us. It explains everything in a very detailed manner (describing molecule shape affects it's role in the body, how alcohol's depressant affects work a similar mechanism to valiums, etc), and then goes a step further to give a simple break down of the explanation. It is really fascinating how complex the human body and it's interaction with these substances are.Overall, this book is for the type of person with an interest in the science behind these substances, but doesn't have the time/patience to read oodles of medical texts.
__label__1 Good price, poor quality: I bought this to install as a rear display in my truck. It worked well the first few times used, then would no longer turn on. The quality of this unit is just subpar. It's worth the money to buy a better brand.
__label__2 Beautiful product: The bracelet is beautiful and definitely sparkles with color in the light. I expected it to be made with smaller beads and to be daintier, but it is lovely anyways!
__label__2 Beautiful Bracelet: The bracelet I ordered and received was beautiful. I am very pleased with the bracelet and the prompt delivery of the items I ordered.
__label__1 Worst icing money can buy: Please do me a favor and do not buy this icing.It's probably the worst icing i've ever tasted before. I would rather have the fake whipped cream icing (they put on the pre-made cakes) from our local grocery store then this stuff.It's got a terrible after-taste that is woody/very artificial.
__label__1 overpaid: this product is much cheaper in the store. about half the price. i thought i would be receiving bigger tubs.
__label__2 great book and movie: Have a friend who is going through breast cancer and this book and movie have turned her attitude towards what she is facing around.
__label__2 Kris Carr Rocks!: Kris is living a very inspiring life and she tells her story with courage and humor. I recommend this DVD to everyone.
__label__2 For a young person with cancer, this is very uplifting.: I'd heard so much about this book on the 'cancer support' blogs that I wanted to read it and was so pleased to get it at such a good price. The attitude is very uplifting for a person experiencing cancer, as long as you can accept the author's 'non-religious' way of dealing with her diagnosis. Some readers with cancer may not be able to accept a person who didn't have to have surgery, chemo or radiation as representative of their own cancer journeys, and may not relate to this author. Most of the author's avant garde diet and bowel cleansing routines to hold her cancer at bay were over the top for me, but if you have an open mind and are able to read around her ideas you disagree with, there are many good tips and life-affirming philosophies that make this a worthwhile read for a cancer patient/survivor.
__label__2 Excellent Advice: Anyone involved in a Workers Comp claim, even if you already have an attorney, will benefit from reading this book. It's lengthy, but very worthwhile. This book will give you all the information you will need to make good decisions and to know what to expect during the whole process. You will find information that your attorney may not tell you! You need to know all of your options as well as your responsibilities.
__label__2 Great Reference: This is a very easy to use and understand self help legal book. Thorough and complete on almost all subjects related to workers comp. Nolo is a top notch legal self help publisher. Highly recommended.
__label__1 don't waste your money: We bought these traps to catch some stray cats and transport them to a rescue organization. The first problem occurred when we tried to set them- they would NOT set. Every time we tried the hook came loose when we let go of the door. A little fiddling with pliers took care of that- the hook stayed put and the trap sprung as expected when tested. We put the trap out and it broke the first time a cat sprung it. The entire metal arm on the outside of the cage was bent out of shape and no amount of repair attempts could fix it. We weren't able to use the trap a second time. Big waste of money.
__label__1 cheap metal: I have to say that the crystal is a beautiful color and well represented by the picture. I was expecting sterling silver (especially for this price) but it looks like nickel. I am returning them because of the metal.
__label__2 One of the Best: The book Lena is one of the best I have ever read. I wish I could have known Lena. I have met the author. She's a wonderful womam.
__label__2 Precise and exhilarating: This book is exactly what it says it is: a fantastic compilation o Ericsson's stories. A must read for anyone interested in his life
__label__2 The Crazy Joker: Have you ever looked for a book that kills you with laughter? Well, here is your answer. Just joking is a book by Andy Griffiths and Terry Denton. The mission of this book is just plainly making you get a heart attack (of laughter). In the book every chapter has a different joke. It is not a normal book of jokes but it is a story in which the character does the jokes. Read it!!!!
__label__1 Just use a flame-thrower: I - fool that I am - have had three WB Crockerys (two by marriage).All three were way too hot to trot: the low setting in each of the units promptly shot past 220 degrees.That ain't slow cooking, that's dumb-ass boiling.Just now $15.00 worth of Angus is sitting in a broth of burned vegetable smoosh in the kitchen.But - hey! - it's o.k. A little later on we be target practicin'.And Worst Bend #3 is gonna die a lot.
__label__1 Don't Buy This!: This item is overpriced for it's features and the crock is poorly made. I bought one and the crock craacked, so I exchanged it and a few months later the new one cracked again. It was a small crack so I kept using it, and then it cracked AGAIN and the original crack got bigger so instead of 2 tbsp of fluid leaking out during cooking, it just continuously leaks and is unusable. Pshh! I was unable to return it a second time so I have lost my 50$. I cannot find a replacement crock. The West Bend website wasn't helpful. I will not buy West Bend products now. I originally bought it because it is large and has a black + stainless exterior. Also, after the first one cracked I was careful not to expose it to fast temperature changes (which cause cracking). It still cracked.
__label__1 Flaking enamel. . .beware: We got this crockpot about a year ago and have used it maybe 15 times. We hand wash the crockery. The last time we used it, we noticed lots of black flecks in our soup, ranging from tiny (at first we thought it was pepper) to about 1/2 inch in diameter. It was the black enamel of the pot flaking off into our food! When we washed the pot, our sponge was black with enamel. Yuck! I suppose you get what you pay for.
__label__2 Great slow cooker: I got this as a gift. I have only used it twice and with great results. The first time I made a pot roast with beef, vegetables and barley. Cooked it for 7.5 hours and it turned out great! The next time I used vegetables, chicken and rice. Since I was going to be away longer and did not want the vegetables to turn to mush, I made a "Hobo" pack- that is, season the veggies, wrap them in foil and placed them over the meat, directly below the lid. The food cooked on low for 10 hours. while the rice was a little mushy, the chicken was great. The stew turned out awesome and the veggies were in a perfect stage of tenderness.This slow cooker did what it needed to do, and I have been pleased with the results.
__label__2 I've used it before and I'll keep using it!: I've used this product in Caracas, Venezuela and I found it to be a very good product that says exactly what it promises. i got a chance to buy it on e-bay in Miami and I'll use it as long as I can get it.
__label__2 The best car wax ever: I had use it for over 10 years and found this product really very easy to use, its component is also nature friendly. I love it.
__label__2 Rising to the Derby?: I've always liked the Star and Christina books, and now that Star is back in racing form, he's doing better than ever! A must read, especially if you've read the books that have mentioned Celtic Mist in them. I'm sooooo happy the books are about racing, I love it! I love jumping, but racing is much more origonal. I can't wait for Team Player to come out!
__label__2 Grand Overview: I consider this book, a good way to begin to appreciate, Mr Adams' life and work. It has helped to strengthen my understanding of the images that Mr Adams makes, and helped me focus on my own journey with my cameras for the last 18 years or so. If you only buy one Robert Adams book this is the one to have.
__label__2 Great strings!: These strings are a lifesaver for someone who's used to nylon strings and wants to transition to steel. Much easier on the fingers than regular (even 'light') strings.
__label__2 Insight on Scottish Folk Customs: This book is excellent for ethnologists and the curious alike! Although it is out of print, it is a book worth finding! Written in 4 volumes, each takes a look at different parts of the Scottish folk beliefs -from witchcraft and second sight, to songs and stories told over time, this book has it all, and in an easy to read-straight forward fashion. Definitely a book for anyone remotely interested in Scotland or non-christian customs!
__label__2 the firm video with alison: I like this video. It is one heck of a workout. Definately for a more advanced person. It had lots of dance oriented moves.
__label__2 Great workout to compliment a more hard-core workout.: As some reviewers have said, this video is pretty quick paced. But, if you are familiar with basic moves (lunges, etc) it isn't hard to catch up with the instructor. The moves are fast, but not tricky. I felt like I got a good workout, but I wouldn't say it was a tough challenge. Adding heavier weights would easily take this workout into a more challenging zone. I really enjoyed this workout though! It went by so quickly and I felt energized upon completion. Some reviewers have also complained about not having enough reps. My thought would be to pause the video and add a few reps of your own. You own the pause button...pause away! Bonus-it is only 31 minutes in length...leaving enough time to do some more hard-core weight training or some pilates if you desire. I will most likely use this video on my more "off" days or follow this up with some intense weight training.
__label__1 A little difficult, not much of a workout: I was really excited when i read the reviews. I always thought that these dancy type workouts never really gave you a workout. But i decided to purchase this DVD anyways since everyone gave such good marks. Unfortunately my original instinct was right. The difficult steps didn't really bother me because i was able to pick them up after a couple of times, but i just didn't feel like i got this great workout when i was done. I didn't really sweat or get my heart rate up much. It's too bad, because i really like Allison and her DVD's.
__label__1 Cheng Shin 27x1-1/4 GumWall Bicycle tires: I bought 4 of these tires for 2 old vintage, very high end 10 speed bicycles from my younger days and fitted them on both bicycles. After the very 1st day of fast long distance training on both bicycles the rear tires ruptured. THESE are useless deadly and UNSAFE TIRES for serious cycling. They should be BANNED From Sales. At speeds of 20-30 mph after 1/2 hour of riding the Sidewalls ripped off the wire bead, this happened on both bicycles on separate days and the pressures were never over 85psi as checked with a digital gauge. I own several High End bicycles and have never seen this happen in the many thousands of miles I have done. I will never buy another of these CHEAP DANGEROUS TRASH. Losing a tire at 20mph is like being thrown out of a car and may be deadly if you spill. Buy only Real Bicycle tires, they may be $25-$50 a piece but they last years and are safe for serious riding.
__label__2 Cellex C Starter Kit: This product is awsome. I noticed a difference after only one use! The stinging sensation can be intense at times, but goes away after about 15 minutes. I do use this product at night instead of day because it makes my foundation "peel" after use in the morning. This product was recommended to me by an aesthitician.
__label__2 This is what Regencies are all about!: Since everyone has already touched on the plot, I see no reason to rehash what's already been said. I simply want to let this be known: THIS IS AN ADORABLE BOOK!This book has everything. It has romance (and lots of it!), mystery, intrigue, comedy, adventure. I hardly ever run across any "page-turners", but this is definitely one of them! I loved the hero; he was to die for. And I love a heroine who can hold her own without being overbearing. Delia is just that.This is the best Regency I've read this year, and the story is so lovely! Do whatever you must to get your hands on this book. You won't regret it!
__label__2 Nicely Done: This was an engaging story with interesting characters. An exciting adventure to go with the romance.
__label__1 Think twice: I bought 2 sets and some separate pieces, one set was ok, the second had two broken pieces: a cup and an 11.5 inch dinner plate, as I had acquired some separate pieces I decided not to return the box, besides I liked the design. After two weeks of using the sets, one dinner plate showed a discoloration and two salad plates broke in the microwave oven, I have decided to return one of the sets, I really question Pfaltzgraff quality, would it be the reason why they sell this tableware at such discounts? Really dissapointed
__label__1 Not so pleased: I bought the camera becasue I loved it's features, price, and ease of controls. However, after six months of ownership those benefits are worthless considering the fact that it can't focus reliably. Only half of my photos are in focus. It doesn't matter if I use a tripod and timer to avoid blurr, and forget action shots. I wouldn't travel with it cause I can't afford to not be able to trust my camera. I wish Vivitar would come out with a software upgrade fix.
__label__1 Why did she make this movie?: While her acting was good, even with an edge, I couldn't see the point for her making the film. It was horribly disappointing, not uplifting at all. I kept wanted to turn it off, yet I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't in my opinion.
__label__2 Tube bruses are hard to find: It's hard to find a brush with a long handle and a small diameter that can go in a small tube. This is it. I'm totally satisfied.
__label__2 great product: The two battery packs i got through amazon, charged and work very well, i recommend them to anyone with a cordless drill.
__label__2 Great !!: I like this DVD very much. Johnny Hiland is a very good teacher. He is naturally talented for teaching guitar.
__label__2 Chicken Pickin': This really is an advanced lesson but is well worth it. The live performance's are a great bonus too.
__label__2 Educational and entertaining: In the world of casino cheating, Richard Marcus once reigned supreme. His 25+ year career as a cheat is entertainingly detailed in this book. In nearly a decade of casino surveillance I have not found any other book give more insight into the mind of a cheater or give as much detail as to how professional casino cheating teams work. I encourage anyone in the industry to read this and to visit Richard Marcus's website to stay informed on the latest casino and gambling related news - no matter which side of the table you're on.
__label__1 dishwasher safe.....: The set was very appealing at first but when I washed the knives the first couple of times, they started to rust. I've only had this set for 2 mos. now and they look to be one hundred years old.I agree, the price is very reasonable, but not reasonable enough just for the few times I've used it. Might as well have bought disposables. Had to throw them out..dont think its safe to be cutting food i'm actually going to put in my mouth with a knife thats loaded with rust.
__label__1 Terrible Headset!!!: The Jabra BT250v headset is terrible. I am trying to use it with one of the latest Samsung phones (a900). People at the other end of my conversation say that I am coming in crystal clear. On my end, there is so much static that I cannot understand anything that is being said. This is with the phone in my chest pocket within 1 foot of the headset. If I set the phone on a table so there is no movement of the phone, and if I hold my head PERFECTLY still, I can understand what is being said on the other end of the line. As soon as I move, even to turn my head, there is nothing but static.Unfortunately, I am going out today to look for a replacement. This was a waste of money!
__label__1 NOT HAPPY: This ear piece has so much static unless I put the phone right next to my earpiece. When it is fully charged the blue light goes out. The light only goes out on this one if its plugged up for three days. I had the bt250 last year and it was fine. I don't know if the seller has a bad batch bt250v with vibrating alert or Jabra should have left a good thing alone.
__label__2 Excellent Performance and great looks: I got this headset after returning 'Logitech Mobile Freedom Bluetooth Headset'. This is very comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. The sound quality is great. The looks are cool. It paired with my RAZR without any problem. So far I have no complaints.
__label__2 Pretty darn good, but...: Syncing with my Treo happens about 95% on the first try, and the remainder get done on the second try. Sound quality & clarity is good, even in moderately noisy locations. Folks at the other end are surprised at the sound quality. It feels a bit lumpy on your ear at first, but after about a minute you forget it's there (unless you try to put on glasses). Battery life is decent, but without some sort of meter it's prudent to keep it on the charger between uses.
__label__2 Mandatory and fun!: I bought this because I had too, and I'm glad i did! It is pretty comfortable, discreet, and has good sound quality.
__label__2 Size matters...: I am a very sporadic bluetooth user, and mainly bought this device for use on long car trips or when I don't feel like holding the phone to my ear. This device goes well beyond all of my technical requirements (great sound transmission on both ends, vibrate alert, pairs well with the LG Chocolate phone), but my only complaint is the fit of the earpiece around my ear. I am a woman, and the earpiece feels VERY loose on my ear when I am wearing it. In fact, when I'm in the car and need to check my blind spots, it has fallen off many times. It is not easy to put onto my ear, so if I need to take calls when I am driving I need to keep the device on my ear for the entire trip. Perhaps I have misshapen ears, but in my opinion a headset should fit a bit more snug to be comfortable. I would suggest trying one before buying one!
__label__1 Good Quality But Unnecessary: These are fine tapes, but there is no need to spend so much money on them.By design, DV and HDV tapes are identical.The only difference is the price.
__label__1 bad quality/great features: We bought this for our staff to do an exercise and they worked great for a little while. One drop, though, and they would not work any more. For instance, mine was on vibrate mode on the countertop and vibrated right off the counter. The alarm/vibrate function never worked again. I like the features and the size it offered but the quality is just not there.
__label__2 Great measuring set: I like the shape of the set, feels solid, labeling is very clear - overall, great addition to my kitchen toolkit.I wish it was possible to get the teaspoon and tablespoon separately - these are the ones I use most for measuring salad dressings and cooking oil, and would be nice not to have to rinse them throughout one cooking session.
__label__1 Warning: These spoons are not standard sizes!: My spouse and I were very excited to get these spoons as a wedding gift, and have been using them in the kitchen. Just recently, we started noticing that the spoons did not look proportional to each other. Upon calibration, it was discovered that some of the spoons are not as large as they state! The tablespoon actually holds about 2/3 of a tablespoon, and the 1/4 teaspoon holds only about 1/6 of a teaspoon (both are 67% of the stated size). The 1 and 1/8 teaspoons appear to be right on, and the 1/2 and 3/4 teaspoons just a smidgen small. We have concluded that the tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon are too far off to use in recipes...if the recipe allows for that much error, then why measure at all?
__label__2 Fits in spice jars: These measuring spoons are a joy to use. They are finely constructed of thick stainless steel and fit into spice jars easily (which many others do not. Beautiful!My only complaint is that they do not include a 1/2 tablespoon measure in the set.
__label__2 Great!: I purchased this for my niece as a gift. It assembled easily, is very sturdy and I didn't find any flaws in the finish or workmanship. It matches other cherry pieces in her and she loves it!
__label__1 Mirror: I guess I was expecting a little more than what this mirror is. The mirror looked ok but not great. The finishing was poor with an uneven finish. The is functional but nothing special. I would just buy a behind the door mirror if I could do it again.
__label__1 The picture on the box probably tastes better: I was really disappointed with these. I think they are way overpriced, don't taste very good (nothing like pizza), and leave a nasty after taste. The only way I could eat them was dipped in something such as hummus and I prefer carrot sticks for that. The picture on the box made them look so yummy :(
__label__2 Great game for us!: My husband loves scrabble. He's always won. When we bought our first house, I bought a small cheap set to "get us started". This past Christmas, he saw the add for the Diamond edition. Researched it, and didn't like the fact that it folded and didn't snap shut. Then I saw this one. Loved it! I love how clean and simple it is. So I bought it, and had to wait to play. Once we did play, it was great. I love the fact that the tiles stay in place (everything is nice and lined up!!), and it turns so nicely. I also love the score keeper. We always used a legal pad. Now we can keep things on permanent record! And the timer is always a nice threat when someone is taking too long. The tiles are a really nice black wood and silver writing(not plastic like I've seen noted). Our only problem is that it is a pretty big box, and had to make a little room to store it.
__label__1 NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Disappointed in quality of construction!: This board is made of cheap materials and thrown together in a way that makes it look flimsy! Not the high quality solid construction that is in the pictures. I was hoping for a really solid nice looking board and THIS IS NOT IT. This looks cheap and is not better than our original board.DO NOT SPEND THE MONEY ON THIS - not worth the extra $50.THUMBS DOWN!
__label__1 This is junk: My Lab had chunks all over the place within 2 minutes, we had to throw it away becasue he was swallowing pieces.
__label__1 From a hard core fan: I have been a hardcore fan of Bjork for 11 years. I have lots of her records, videos, and books. But something I won't have in my collection is this CD. Bjork: we lost you. You lost music. You reinvented yourself into something just you can really understand.Goldfrapp is my new Bjork.
__label__1 Meh: Trying to bandage my cat is like trying to keep cooked spaghetti in a straw. She gets out of this in about 2 minutes flat. It is good and sticky, though, so if a pet can't reach it.....
__label__2 Knife Holder: This is an outstanding product, and was exactly what I was looking for. Over the years I have accumulated more knives than my old holder could handle. This holder accommodates all of my 'odd and end' pieces, plus the new ones I've purchased.
__label__2 A journey of mystical sounds of far off places.: I have known Silvard Kool for the better part of 20 years and listened to his music all most as long. Silvard is a very gifted writer and pianist. On this recording Silvard treats the listener to a journey of mystical sounds of far off places. Honshu Sunrise takes us on a dream like voyage of Asian mists and sounds. I use Silvard's music in teaching Yoga and meditation. I highly recommend this album and also Silvard's other works.
__label__1 Cheap: I was looking for a nice wood cutting board and when I came across this set, I thought it was perfect! My husband does most of the cooking, so I knew he would appreciate the different sizes and I was hoping that the ridges around the edges would help contain his messes.When they arrived, I opened the box and couldn't believe how thin these boards were! The three stacked together were just about as thick as what I would expect one board to be. When they were used, the wood isn't that durable - after just a couple uses, you could see knife marks and splintering.I wouldn't recommend these boards to anyone, although....I did give two stars because you CAN cut on them (so they are somewhat utilitarian).
__label__1 scuse me?: The boards are only 1/2" thick.Sealed with food grade oil? Not mine. They're not sealed with anything. It's dry wood.You get what you pay for.A cheap cutting board.
__label__1 cheap, chemical smell, warps quickly: Whatever vinyl finish they put on these boards is horrible. I tried washing them repeatedly, then finally had to soak them which was terrible on the wood. Only the smallest size is now acceptable to use. They are a good price and the sizes are perfect but the chemical smell is so worrisome that I feel apprehensive about using them because I don't know what will come off on the items I'm cutting.
__label__1 You get that for which you pay...: If this seems like a ridiculous deal for three hardwood cutting boards, well it is. Only problem is two of the boards have split since I bought the set six months ago. I don't know if the wood is not cured correctly or what, but I have certainly not abused these cutting boards, nor have I subjected them to extreme temps or soaked them in water.If I had it to do over again, I would get one good cutting board that would last, as these will have to be replace as they continue to split.[added 4/3/07]Just wanted to update with a note that for $10 I bought a huge heavy-duty wooden cutting board at a certain Swedish superstore. Buy the mineral oil that comes with it and treat it once a year- haven't had any issues with it.
__label__1 Beware Beware of the Pioneer VSX-816: After almost 2 years, I've developed a big problem with the center channel cutting out intermittently. Sometimes I can crank the volume up to a LOUD level (briefly and then turn back down) and the problem is fixed. If not, turning the receiver power on and off usually fixes it. Sometimes I have to unplug the RCA cables from the back of the receiver or jiggle them and that fixes it - sometimes.it's hard to connect the speakers on the back due to the configuration.the remote is confusing, even for a techie.And the sound just isn't that great.Don't buy this.
__label__2 Great item!: This product is cheap insurance for the glass that covers the LCD display on a cell phone. I am using it for my Motorola Rizr Z3. I feel that the material/film is thick enough to add a certain amount of protection to the glass, yet thin enough as not to reduce visibility of the display. One use that I find helpful is that I tend to get finger prints on the glass, but with this material, I don't have to worry about wiping them off with nothing more than a shirt corner instead of having to dig out a lens cleaner. I had no problem measuring and cutting it to fit including rounding the corners to match the display. After applying it, I tried to work the bubbles out. The large bubbles were easy but the small bubbles were not so easy. However, the next day the small bubbles were somehow gone. I definitely recommend this product for your phone.
__label__2 It could be worse: I love the Thoroughbred series. But I'm having some MAJOR issues with the new writers! If I made a list of all the little details that shaped the series, I'm sure the new writers woulnd't know half of it. I would like to know about what happend from the time Christina was 3-12. Maybe a super edition to tie up loose ends at Whitebrooke in that time frame. Not like the 2 books about Cindy.But, about this book, it was really good. It shows that Parker has more depth than Christina's loving, supporting boyfriend who would never leave her. Yea right! How many relationships are really like that? Not many!The book was great, anyone who loves Thoroughbred HAS to read it!
__label__2 ~**..*.Great Book!.*..**~: Team Player I thought was a really good book! It was all to do with Parker and Foxy on there quest for the Olympics, but I think that it was great! But... I was really dissapointed by the ending..... like- I need to know whut happens next! I cant wait another month until the next book comes out! Its WAY too long! And I was kinda dissapointed in Christina and Parkers relationship....( not to tell ya whut happens but...) i think that they outgrew each otha! There not good together n e more! But I wanna hear who they each start seeing!N e ways, READ THE BOOK! but wait til the next book comes out, so that u can read them both @ the same time! And to all u ppl that r writing all this stuff like " where did Cindy go? " or.. " these authors don't no the story" then like.... stop reading the sereis if ur complaining that much!! The authors can't write bout Every1 they've ever introduced in the books! jeez! give it up!
__label__1 Going down the track to boredom: Let me see--Parker, the perfect child. Whoa, suddenly he needs money? GASP! Oh no! So he gets a horse, which should be left out, he deserves the break. Foxy is almost killed, what happened to Parker like promising never to hurt her way back when he first got her and hurt he? Well?Parker, you're a horrible character.Will someone get the facts right please? We can write better then these writers. C'mon guys!
__label__2 Picture is a little confusing.: The picture of these boards makes them look very thin and transparent... so I wasn't really expecting much at all. But they are NOT transparent or translucent... they are great heavy-duty items that will do fine! Much better than expected.
__label__1 left behind slice-marks: i used it twice and it left small slice marks after the first use-cutting onions(i used a small sharp cutting knife). It looks like it's been used more than the two times i used it. If slice marks don't bother you, then it's worth $15 dollars. Personally, I wish I would have gotten something of higher quality that wouldn't leave slice marks in the cutting board.
__label__2 Family Celebrations: This book can transform you into one of those folks who can provide a toast, prayer or poem for any family celebration whether it be a tooth fairy visit, a memorial service, a fortieth birthday, a housewarming, a baby's birth or even a second marriage. Or, use its quotable words (with attribution, of course) for a greeting in one of those handsome blank greeting cards that fill today's card stands. And may you have "a thousand days like today!" (author unknown).
__label__2 Let There be Drums: Pretty cool CD, but, know up front that it is drums only. Some people would probably get annoyed by that.I like it because I was a professional drummer for years with a dance band.It is song after song of good strong drumming. If you expect something different, this is not for you.By the way, I see all kinds of prices here. I bought it new, about a week ago, for $15.If you are a drummer, or a drummer wanna-be, you could certainly practice with this. You could also use it for party music, especially if there is dancing. I gave it a 5 because, as a drumming only CD it is excellent.If you are into metaphysical meditation with drumming, you could use it for that too
__label__1 Terrible product: Smelled like it just came off the assembly line when I opened the box. Neither of the two I got worked for more than ten minutes. Piece of junk.
__label__2 Good song....: ....but the single Pt. 2 is better. I like the unedited version better than the radio edit version. Altho the video's kool.
__label__1 Rear visor won't stay.: I ordered these window visors because they were inexpensive. Installation was easy except for the driver's side rear window. The adhesive won't hold. No matter how much I try to press on the visor and the window trim to make good contact, the visor won't stick when the window is down. The visor stays fine with the window up as the pressure of the window against the trim keeps it in place. I would not drive anywhere with the window down as the visor will fly off. Looks like I'll be buying double sided tape this weekend to try to get it to stick. Very disappointed. On the bright side, the front visors stick very well.
__label__1 Is this some sort of joke?: The add says "customers buy this with the Canon DC330" but the battery does'nt work with the DC330. How stupid!
__label__2 Angelic Voices: What a wonderful adventure. Not only did I travel and experience with the characters, but my own life became an overlay for each step of the adventure. The odyssey and messages became my journey and opportunity to experience my life through a different perspective - actually several. This is not only great entertainment. It is transformative.
__label__2 Not everyone can have a pretty horse: I recommend this book because of what the main character goes through. The main character, Elizabeth, is the stable groom at Nolly Stables where she works because she loves horses. Her parents are middle class and cannot afford to give her the expensive riding clothes and horses that she thinks that she needs (because she sees everyone else around her with them).When her father gives her a beat-up small pinto horse Elizabeth is far from being grateful and sees it as an embarrasment rather than a horse that she should be happy to finally have. Over the course of the book her attitude changes and in the end she values the Ragman much more.Growing up it is easy to dream of all of the things that a person does not have but this book puts it all in perspective. For this reason it might be a good book for a parent to give their child who is just getting started in riding and is facing the same problems as Elizabeth.
__label__1 You get what you pay for: Nice looking set, but they have a tendency to rust. Also I have to sharpen them quite a bit before using them for most vegetables (onions, tomatos). I can't really complain given the price, and in buying Farberware, I shouldn't expect Henckels or Wusthof quality, but I must say that the dullness and rust are very annoying.
__label__2 diverting but not too taxing..: I love logic puzzles and the like so this seemed like it would be something I'd enjoy. I found the book to be interesting, but the solutions to the puzzles were generally a bit easy, I often managed to pick out the clue and solve the puzzle after just one read through. I have read all the Sherlock Holmes books though - so I am kind of attuned to such foreshadowing....This would make a great book for younger people, who might find such a book a good introduction to logic puzzles.
__label__2 This is a great tool kit!: It has everything that you could need. I lost most the pieces after a few months, but I would recommend just parting out a tool kit and buying each piece individually. Each piece was quality built though!
__label__1 Seems more like stamped metal rather than diecast: Heading says it all. Product description says it is die-cast. If it is, it's awfully flimsy. I was hoping for something less likely to twist.
__label__2 Lets Hear It For The Laurie Berkner Band: I was very excited to see the DVD available! The day our DVR accidentally erased the Noggin special was one of the worst days in our house :(Wondering why "Family" isn't on it.We just saw her live - worth every penny to see all of the kids full of so much excitement & joy!
__label__2 St. Petersburg: Architecture of the Tsars: One of the most beautiful books I've ever come across, St. Petersburg:Architecture of the Tsars is a must for those interested in Imperial Russian history, architecture, or both. The lavish book aptly illustrates the architecture of the former capital of the tsars, from the exuberant Russian Baroque of Peter the Great, to the neoclassicism of Catherine the Great, to the Art Nouveau of Nicholas II. With chapters arranged in chronological order, the book illustrates the development of the city through the reigns of each tsar/tsaritsa, and includes seperate chapters on Pavlovsk, Tsarskoe Selo, and Peterhof. The book is well worth the price.
__label__2 Better then most: Better then most Elephant Man books. Fairly objective presentation of subject material, good exploration of fictional interpretations and first hand accounts.Yes this is clearly best Elephant Man book.
__label__1 Very Unstable!!!: Even after installing the 2 updates it still freezes (Windows XP). DO NOT upgrade to version 8 ...
__label__2 It's SSSSUUUUPPPPEEEERRRR!: As a #1 fan this movie is super good.I have seen it like 'bout 3 times or something like that you should buy it!
__label__2 sturdy: Relatively sturday for a plastic product. Slides nice. Just right for our needs. Would recommend to others.
__label__2 Grand Expectations: I received this book promptly and the book is in good condition. I found it usable and helpful for my needs.
__label__1 Sarah Palin would not approve: This book is too biased against conservatives. If you love this country and believe in Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck, skip this book and stick with the Patriots History of the United States.
__label__1 Not really much here: Should be entitled "Theory of Clocks," because there're only a dozen pages or so about how to make a repair. And the info there is like "How to file a gear tooth." Well, when are you supposed to do that?
__label__2 Mr. Trower: Lost in the Hendrix shadow, Trower was and still is one of my favorites ever. It was nice to see him giving the lessons instead of a stand-in showing you Robin's licks. Also, Trower is probably the 'face-pulling king'. You can really see him getting into every note he plays. This won't make you sound like him, or even play but so much like him...but it was cool to see and figure out how he did a few of those riffs. A must-have for any Trower fan, whether you play or not. He seems so likable and humble, almost meek at times....until he plays. Most people forget him because of Clapton, Beck and Page...but every real guitarist knows who he is, and I believe that's how Mr. Trower likes it.
__label__2 Stokes Select Clamp on Deck Hook: I purchased this after buying one locally for roughly twice the price. When I received it I was amazed at how hefty it is. The only problem I ran into was that the clamp wouldn't fit around the railing of my deck. I had to remove the screw clamp. No biggie. I like it and would buy one again.
__label__2 Ideal for laptop: The hub I got doesn't look like the one in the picture. This one is silver with a blue light in the middle of it and all four of the ports are on one side. The one I got works fine. It is ideal for a laptop. Just in case you are wondering thr cord which attaches to the computer IS that short.
__label__1 Over Priced!!!!!!!!: Its cheaply made. The connectivity is unreliable- any budge of your laptop will make this thing disconnect.I think most hubs come with 220v compatability so its no special trait here.
__label__2 Magical: The title track of this CD is one of my favorites. "Rascal" addresses the reality of the empty nest, with humor and love. Also on this CD are four very poignant songs: "Heartbeat of Heaven" - a prayful song; "Breathing" - a man's celebration of marriage; "Sense of Humor" - a tribute to a loved one who has passed on; "I Know Exactly What Love Is" - a very powerful song about a woman's life from the time she is a little girl until she dies. I think that everyone can relate to every song on this CD at some level. Don Whites songs and spoken word pieces are uplifting.
__label__1 Hard Vice - not so hard not so anything: Shannon Tweed, only semi good in her own brand of softer adult films. In this movie she plays a cop trying to catch a killer that goes out at night as a call girl and kills the men who pay her to give them a good time. Don't waste your money on this one, its not worth it!
__label__2 good phone but not as user friendly as it could be: Battery life is very good. Phone has good range. My only complaint is it's to involved to get your message from the handset.
__label__1 Lousy customer service: I ordered a new version of this phone system and they arrived promptly. However one of the 4 phones didn't work. So I called customer service and they told me to send it back to them at my expense. I therefore had to pay for the box, go to the PO and pay to ship it. NOT GREAT but ok, sorta, but not really. I paid what I paid for working phones, not mostly working plus extra postage and time. Then after a week or so they send me back a replacement model. BUT THE UNIT WAS A REBUILT UNIT, NOT NEW! I didn't pay for rebuilt. I payed for NEW. I didn't get what I paid for, namely 4 new phones that work, I got for additional time, money and hassle, 3 new phones and 1 rebuilt phone. I called them again and they said, sorry, that all we have. No offer to reimburse me for postage, not offer to make it better. Just sorry. Well me too!Panasonic, you failed at basic customer relations. For a few bucks you made an enemy. Kinda expensive if you ask me.
__label__1 PHONE BEEPS AND HAS HOLLOW SOUND!: I tried to contact the seller of this item, but got no response. Said they were on vacation. I am using two of the phones since these are the only ones I have! Will not buy from this seller again.
__label__2 Odd line-dead sound, but still connected: These phones have been just fine. The only complaint I have is that while you are speaking to someone, it sounds to you like the line has gone dead, but it hasn't. Eventually, you will hear it come back "alive" again. I am assuming that this is maybe due to the Dect 6.0 "quiet" feature. As long as you learn to ignore it and trust that you are still connected, there's no problem. Great product for the money.
__label__2 THE PHONE to purchase!: This is the best phone I've owned and I've had numerous phones. It is easy to program. Only enter numbers in the main phone, then send them to the other phones. This phone has it all! The voice clarity is great and the volume control is more than adequate. Select from numerous ringtones. I highly recommend this product - you can't go wrong.
__label__2 Panasonic Dect 6.0 review: I purchased this phone system about 4 weeks ago and have been very happy with it. The speaker phone works great. I love that you can hear messages being left on every handset, not just the base unit (I don't always like to answer the phone, so like to hear if the message was important). Range seems fine. I have a three level home and never have a problem. Very clear reception on all handsets. Only item that's not great is when you save a number to the address book, you have the option save the number to another handset but can't save to all at once.
__label__2 The volume could be louder: I like the phone, its features and performance, but I wish the volume of the handset or a headset could be set louder. The speakerphone volume is loud enough for me.
__label__1 The real playbook is,,,, fake reviews: This is book is clearly a slapdash effort to get published. If it were from academia it would be the product of the "publish or perish" mentality. There are a few useful bits of information, but finding them is hard and they would be best condensed into a magazine article. The writing style demands, not comands, attention. Don't expect a page-turner here.While I won't recommend this book, as a first effort from the authors it is not that bad. What is sad, though, is that this website was salted with positive reviews, probably from friends. Maybe this is the hidden play in the playbook, taken from Microsoft's PR department, meant to make a second-rate product look good. They impugn book the book and the site.Summary: First, don't judge this book by online reviews. Second, wait for the 2nd edition.
__label__1 No shame for these guys!!!!!: Amazing that when REAL reviews are written, Zag & Tong resort to using cronies to counter the latest and most honest reviews (for example, Malloy & Goldberg work for the same company as them -- Ignition Partners). Is this the same level of shamelessness these two used to "market" the Microsoft monopoly?Obviously, the two of you are concerned that the book does not stand on its own merits.
__label__1 Weak: this book gives a lot of theoretical overview-type knowlege that is pretty useless if you want to go out and promote a product or service. it seems like the authors spent more time trying to promote their cute analogy about marketing being like sports than actually giving some information that you could take back to your company and turn into sales.
__label__1 Missing Link lacked that certain something......: This book was extremely detailed and that's good but I felt that there was to much time spent on the details and not enough on the relationship between the two characters. At times, I was tempted to put it down because whenever Shanna took a bath it was described in detail. The chemistry between Shanna and Craig was minimal and the usual tension was missing. And although I believe in family, there was way too much family in this book. This is the second book I've read by Ms. Dickerson and I'm hesitant to buy another. Missing Link lacked that certain something that I look for when reading a romance novel.
__label__1 Hedge Trimmer has a problem: If you happen to run into a branch 3/8 or more one of the blades jumps offthe crank and it locks up. A shim in the crank area gets tangled up and has to be replaced frequenly. I have two of these and both have the same problem.It can be fixed but it takes time. If you can avoid larger branches it worksfine but it only takes once. I have all the other attachments too which work fine especially the saw.
__label__1 Hedge Trimmer Useless for Older Person: I purchased the Mantis E-System Hedge Trimmer with great expectations. They did not come true. First the unit is poorly balanced and difficult to operate. Next it has a built in engineering fault. After 45 minutes the unit froze up. I returned it and the second one froze up after another 35/40 minutes. I returned it and asked they properly repair the unit instead of sending me another new one with the same built in problem but they did not, instead sent me another new unit. I now have the third one but in 105 degree weather the hedge has stopped growing so I don't have anything to try it on. I doubt it will hold up though because the first two had a disc or shim in the gear housing that failed and I suspect they all do. These trimmers are just too heavy, poorly balanced, and faulty for a 77 year old to operate.
__label__1 Waste of money and time!: PLEASE do not buy this pump. Ours died after a couple of weeks of use. And we did not even use it every day. What was worse was the customer service at AquaLeisure, the company who makes Simpleset pools and pumps. I think they only had one phone line, because it was busy every time I called. I litterally called 50-100 times with my redial button over several days. We ended up buying another brand of pump that is stronger, the Intex 1000, which has a much better rating. Think twice before you buy Simpleset. It's not worth the trouble.
__label__1 Missing Chris in the Morning...: This is such a shiny, perfectly cut, little studio album. It's not great, but it's not the worst. It's middle of the road with a couple of catchy tunes that make it a worthwhile purchase. The main problem seems to be that I find it hard to believe John Corbett, a man who I know to be a star of small and big screen, to have the knocks in life that you tend to hear about in country songs. Plus, every once in a while you hear his voice through the singing and you think, "That's Chris in the Morning" or "That's Aidan" and you can't listen to it anymore without it being weird.
__label__1 John has done the impossible!!: This is,hands down,the worst..WORST album ever made..the worst actor/musician album as well..not necessarily in that order. He makes Leonard Nimoy's musical foray look like unimpeachable genius.He has cobbled together a truly horrid collection of wholly derivative stock-in-trade country-isms in a miserable attempt at musical legitimacy.he has done the impossible: He has managed to make a terrible,disingenuous genre even more worse than before.Take that,Rascal Flatts,you shiny,overly-processed cheese dandies.I regret to say this album is a stain on the face of music.
__label__2 on da grind: ghetto mafia put out cuts that everyone can relate to.on da grind is one of their top hits.this song is requested at every party i give.for those who haven't heard it should go purchase it like A.S.A.P no joke.
__label__2 A Great "Fit": Angelina books each add something. Never just fluff. Not just a need to create another story with a minimal variation. Sometimes she leads and in this instance learns her own significance and that she does fit in. If a parent talks of this story it can be used to illustrate emotions, ups and downs. the fickleness of people and the many cycles of life.The art work for many reasons is always a treat.
__label__1 Just A Warning!!: If you don't buy this item from Amazon make sure that it's NOT the "Sanitized" version. I bought the "Sanitized" version thinking that the label on the front was some kind of a joke not realizing all of the videos and footage I was missing. Missing from the "Sanitized" version are:Videos-"You're All I Need""Primal Scream""Anarchy In The UK""Afraid""Misunderstood""Enslaved""Hooligan's Holiday""Hell On High Heels"Also missing is the interview with Tommy Lee & Nikki Sixx along with all of the Alternate Videos. I'm definitely going to have to buy an unedited copy. I feel that I really got screwed with my copy.
__label__2 Nice bits: I am very pleased with this set. These bits cut cleanly and do not burn your workpiece. The finished edge is very smooth. I have used Crafstman and viper bits before, and these are much better. With lesser quality bits, I spent a lot of time carefully going over the edge removing burn marks and smoothing out spintering. Never again.
__label__1 Great movie, lousy copy!: As I said in the title, this is a great movie, but an extremely lousy copy!! I would not suggest buying this one, since it comes out of Canada, and I've noticed with many of their video and audio products, they seem to be really bad pirated copys! I bought this movie, in the regular dvd format, and the picture was extremely poor and blurry! And this copy seems just as bad!! Don't waste your money!
__label__2 heard good things: I will soon purchase this case because a friend has mentioned this product to me. Looking at the pictures that are posted, it looks really nice and reliable.
__label__2 BRIGHT... VIVID .........AMAZING 3-D: You know the movie, what will keep you comming back is the high bitrate quality they use, the 3-d effects are so good that they look like solid objects suspended in air its that good unbelievable clarity for 3-d, 1000 times better effects than the red blue glasses dvd. I use a lcd Epson projector for my 3d display this is the only brand i have found to work with lcd shutterglasses movies with excelent clarity, looks great on crt projectors and glass televisions as well...... a must buy
__label__1 Ummmm, OK: This movie had barely any cool 3-D sequences, was boring, and babyish. Juni gets zapped into a video game. The acting is pretty bad, and there is pretty much no story. It's just flying around on machines. Is that entertainment or what(sarcasm) ? You could enjoy it if you were a 3 year old, but, since you are on this site, you probably aren't three, so I would not reccomend this movie to you.
__label__1 The worst one yet: The first Spy Kids movie was enjoyed by all in our family and our kids insisted on seeing all of the sequels. They should have stuck to the first one as in so many cases. Did not have the same energy and quirkiness that the first movie had. The characters also did not interact with each other in that easy way found in the the first movie.
__label__1 KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!: KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL, ALL, ALL, TIME SINCE THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE AND BEFORE THAT! IN THEATERS I WAS THE ONLY ONE WATCHING THAT MOVIE AND I FELT LIKE WALKING OUT!! I WANTED TO CRY :( THE ACTORS STINK ALONG WITH THE PLOT AND 3-D EFFECTS!!!All I can say is BOOOOOOOOOO THIS MOVIE SUCKS!
__label__1 Worst movie ever: I've seen so many dreadful movies and I'll admit that this is the worst movie that I've ever seen. Sylvester Stallone has been in so many excellent films and this is easily his worst film. It amazes me that he agreed to star in this pathetic movie. I guarantee at this time that even he thinks of this movie as horrendous.
__label__2 This was a good movie...: Ok, well, first off... This movie was ok. I was expecting a better storyline. I was sort of confused the first time I saw it so I went back a second time. I'm not sure why but after I saw it a second time I thought it was a better movie and I went back to see it 4 more times. The only bad part of this movie was that it was in 3-D... I could have been without that because after the movie you get a REALLY bad headache. And another bad part was that Alexa Vega (Carmen) was only really part of the last few minutes of the movie, she is one of the major stars of the Spy Kids trilogy so she should have had a bigger part. But overall, this was a good movie and I recommend buying it.
__label__2 Excelente!: This really is a great movie. I am a Spanish teacher and this movie provides my students the opportunity to discuss the realities of immigration, family customs, and a parents love and responsibility to their child.
__label__1 A sticky mess: This product was very disappointing. No matter what I did the cookies stuck like crazy!! Don't wast your money on this one.
__label__1 Horrible!: The sticks don't stay in and my star cookie broke when I tried taking them out of the sheet. A total waste of money!
__label__1 Excuse me: This jacket was a gift for my daughter. Its listed as an X-Large with no note of sizes running small. It showed up and instead of fitting my 17 year old, it will barely fit my 7 year old. The sleeves were damaged and it looked like an animal was playingwith it prior to shipping. Buyer beware!
__label__2 Best Alternative: For older wide format printers which no longer accept the 9-10 mil photo papers, this glossy paper solves the problem neatly and delivers gorgeous prints. I've experienced no jams with this product.
__label__1 Not what you expect: This photo paper is Epson and it is photo paper. That is as far as it gets.I have toilet paper that is thicker and stiffer than this paper.Not what I expected.
__label__1 falls short: Sure I love the Beatles. And while I don't have much of an ear for classical, there is a lot I like. And I'm a sucker for rock music with real string sections. But this CD just doesn't hold my interest; it sounds like elevator classical. Who'd've thunk that one could make a string arrangement of Yesterday or Yellow Submarine that would bore me?Perhaps if I could discern the "wittily chopped up [variations comparable to those] which Mozart and Beethoven wrote on the well-known songs of their own day," I'd like it more. But my wife (who plays in a local symphony, and does have an ear for classical motifs) also finds the songs uninspiring.The only tracks which held my interest were Help and Can't Buy Me Love.
__label__1 Please pay attention!: I haven't heard this disc, but I CAN clear up the way the music was credited. If you look back through all of the Beatles discs, all Lennon AND McCartney tunes were credited "Lennon-McCartney". Therefore, the above references are correct in repeating that formula.
__label__1 I'd rather watch Barney.: Half way through this movie, my 12-year old daughter said, "I'd rather watch Barney." It fails even as a B-movie because it tries too hard . The plot is lame in it's predictability and the acting is forgettable. Some of the best parts of the original novel were left out. The redeeming feature is that it did not have a comedic ending.
__label__2 Works very well but not an easy project: I bought this for my Freud 3-1/4 HP plunge router on a Jessem Rout-n-Slide router table. Putting it together proved to be a fairly intense process, including a difficult job of forcing four small compression locking pins onto the legs of the router. However, when I managed to finish installing the Router Raizer on the router, it is really wonderfully easy to raise or lower the bit using the deceptively simple handle bar. I recommend it highly if you don't mind a complex installation.
__label__1 Aspen stinks: This video is a huge disappointment! I bought it because it stared Sam Elliot, and he is usually great. This made for TV miniseries is very poor quality video and the acting stinks. Filmed at a lodge back in the 60's or early 70's; there is a lot of "prior filmed footage" much like the earlier war movies used official news video from WWI. I only got as far as about 20 minutes into the first disc and turned it off. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.
__label__2 Early Sam Elliot: As a Sam Elliott fan I purchased this on his name alone.It is a vary early mini series and unfortunately the quality of production shows through.Otherwise the story is enjoyable.
__label__2 Back to the 70's: I had never seen this mini series before. It was typical of the multipart minis of that time. Very entertaining, but tame by today's offerings
__label__2 A good read: In an approach similar to that of Tracy Kidder, Joanne Jacobs spends time immersed in a California charter school. I grew up and went to school in San Jose so the problems that are explored in this book had special meaning to me. I had friends who slipped through the cracks educationally and many were poor Latino and Asian students like the ones profiled in this book. I'm glad to see that people are waking up and working towards solutions to the problem of the chronically underperforming socially promoted student. This book gave me hope that things can be better if we are willing to explore alternative options and believe in the potential of all our students.
__label__1 The Gourmet Cookbook: As a long time Gourmet magazine subscriber, how excited I was to receive this long awaited cookbook..that is until I opened it! What numbskull decided to print the recipe titles in pale yellow on white stock? What a waste. I'm returning the book and hopefully others will follow suit. Maybe the publisher will get the message that a book is worthless if it cannot be read!
__label__1 Cook Book Collector: I coudn't wait to buy the new Gourmet cookbook and then when I did, I was disappointed. I can't even look through the recipies because I can't read the titles without difficulty. The print is light yellow. Not sure what your book designer, art director, and graphic artist had in mind...or what the Gourmet editorial staff and Houghton Mifflin Publishers approved, but please rethink and reprint. Hard to belive book in the works for so long would get printed like this. I'm going to return the book and, hopefuly, someday you will reprint a readable version.
__label__1 Invisible recipe titles...: I thought I might be able to toss the hundreds of Gourmet Magazine issues weighing down my house but no. I cannot read the recipe titles, they are yellow, pale yellow. Makes the book useless, despite how great the recipes probably are. So, until they fix this, save your magazines.
__label__2 Great fit - last long time: I love these SPANX knee highs! They fit great. They wash up nicely and will last a couple of years through summer and winter (because i don't like to wear socks). They don't lose their shape or start to fall down the leg, because of the nice comfortable band.
__label__2 Where is The Camping Episode and Survival of the Idiots???: It's not the happiest moments without those two! And if I go back to Seasons 1-4 there are several more that should be included. Maybe it would have been a better idea to make the 20 Happiest Moments instead!
__label__2 Great Book!!: This book does an excellent job at covering all the aspects of playing and coaching tennis. He divides tennis into 3 parts: the physical, the mental, and the emotional and he covers all three areas well. For example, he writes about your "role" when you play someone: are you the underdog or the favorite (he gives several other roles too)? He explains how to be comfortable with your role and how to excell in your role. He also writes about the different types of player personalities and how to best motivate them as a coach. I thought this book was just great.
__label__2 Good stuff!: ...but not quite what I've been used to. I LOVED it, don't get me wrong, but I think that those who have complained about the difference in Shiloh's character have a point. However, I didn't like Island of the Innocent quite as much at the first reading, either (and I have but 15 minutes ago finished my first reading of this), and then it grew on me with successive readings. Thanks, Lynn and Gilbert, for not ending the story with this! I am REALLY looking forward to the "Cheney and Shiloh" series.
__label__2 Good Product but just needs a better execution: The primary reason for purchasing this product would be to keep a puzzle together. For this purpose the product is sufficient. The product is applied to the backside of a puzzle and does keep the puzzle together, though there is still some flexibility in the puzzle once everything is said and done. However, it would be nice if the product came with more sheets (to do bigger/more puzzles). In addition there are a few accessories that are not really needed. First the box contains removable tape to flip your puzzle, though this seams too weak to be useful (other reviews have commented on this). I preferred to use two pieces of cardboard/glass (Since I was ultimately going to frame the puzzles I used the frame glass and backing cardboard). Also there are two hanging tabs. These, however, look like the plastic hangers for packaging to go on the hooks for store shelfs. In all honesty I would rather see more sheets and forego the other accessories.
__label__2 Works OK when you use large flat surfaces like cookie sheets to turn the puzzle over.: Turning the puzzle over works best when you have 2 large flat areas. Scrapbooking boards &/or large cookie sheet or sheet cake pans were very useful. The surface tape included was only marginally useful - certainly not good enough by itself to turn the puzzle. The hanger works fine. Box includes only 2 hangers which isn't anywhere near enough to use all the sticker sheets.
__label__1 A Waste Of Paper: In this day and age, how can anyone take this book seriously? To rate hitters by batting average is simply a waste of effort because on-base percentage and slugging percentage correlate far better with scoring runs and winning games than batting average.
__label__1 If it worked as good as it looks.: The short story is that my first purchase of this drill was that the hammer function failed after 20 or so holes. Thinking it a fluke, I accepted a replacement. However, I would trade the speed (used for smaller drill bits) for torque. 7/8 auger drill 2/3 into a 4x6 jammed.
__label__1 liked the concept, did not like the book: I loved the whole concept of "investigating" comic book culture but i just got bored with this book...It might be a good book if you intend to write an essay (it reads like one long essay) but there is no theme, no story, no news, no conviction...where is the author? What is running in his head? What does he want to tell us apart from the fact that there is such a thing as "comic book culture"?Okay...so there is a culture...why read the book?
__label__1 Horribly cheap wood, chipped wood, wobbly --AVOID!: There are many negative Amazon reviews of products from Winsome but I really needed some TV table trays and I thought, come on, how bad can they really be? Answer: REALLY bad. Chipped wood (not damage from shipping...they just used chipped wood), horrible finish, and very wobbly. A mild bump into these and your food will be on the floor. How hard is it to make a product that at least approaches acceptable standards?? Does this manufacturer have no pride AT ALL in what they produce?? Amazon must be spending a fortune on the postage for the return of cr*p made by this company.
__label__2 for the money -- great buy: after reading some of the horrible reviews, i was really hesitant in buying these trays. But compared to the prices i saw elsewhere i figured they were worth the 70 bucks (free shipping). Im glad i did, they are simple easy to use table trays ... i wasnt expecting custom wood with excellent castle style finishes becasue i didnt pay for that. For the complainers (always are going to be some) you get what you pay for, the trays are fine, do the job but arent idiot prooof. If you push the table it falls, if you put too many plates they wont fit, if you bang them they will scratch.its a good buy for the price, if you want mahogany wood or other similar high priced woodwith excellent finishes, contact a woodssmith and get ready to pay more then 70.cheers
__label__1 Avoid: I was expecting a tour d' force such as Mixed Bag. Not to be fulfilled. The songs are slowed down to the pace of dirges. Two tracks are wasted on 60's-esqu banter with the audience--once is enough, but after once, you'd rather have 2 more songs. Get a studio album. They are all great.
__label__1 Tedious: Oh joy! A new V.I. book...at last a big, thick novel to burrow into to forget my own problems and those of the world. Gosh, did I get it wrong! If I had saved the receipt, I would taken advantage of the money-back guarantee.I buy novels to escape and here Paretsky dumps her political views, which are confused at best, on my front doorstep like a case of stinking fish. These days you can't turn on the radio or tv or read a newspaper without being assaulted by political vitriol. Now we have to be worried about novels. I think we need a new rating - HPC - heavy political content.I slogged through the rhetoric to see if my guess was correct but didn't buy the ending - it was just too tidy. And by the time I got there, I really didn't care. I was just glad it was over. I closed this book feeling very unsatisfied and very disappointed.If this is what we can expect in the future from Paretsky, I will get the book from the library so I can return it when my eyes glaze over in boredom.
__label__2 Above-average V.I.: BLACKLIST is Parestsky's very fine homage to the late Ross Macdonald. VI Warshawski's investigation of a reporter's murder uncovers a cesspool of fifty-year-old family troubles: infidelities, intrigues, backstabbing, betrayal and general rich-folk cussedness -- but the book is marred by ham-fisted political "messages". But ride over that -- otherwise this is as good a tale as Paretsky has ever told. Which is to say, very, very good.Happy reading!Pete Tillman
__label__1 Who's going to blacklist V.I?: Who's gonna tell the Crown Princess of Crime Novels that she's gotta put out or get off the throne?At one point in the novel "Blacklisting," the infamous although not really all that interesting P.I. V.I. Warshawski, remarks that she needs more friends. Truer words were never spoken.Paretsky, in her 20-something V.I. novels, has spent too little effort developing V.I.'s character and supporting cast. So aside from her doctor friend Lottie, we find history to be Paretsky's crutch because she can't come up with a suitably well-rounded life for V.I. Or, if V.I. is meant to be a "tortured loner" type, then let's see that angle worked up.While the Federal Theater Project's history is interesting, it's not interesting enough to hold a plot together. In fact, that should be V.I's job. But Paretsky seems more tired than usual and more than ever resting on her reputation. But if one looks back to the first books in the series, one might find the same problem.
__label__1 Was this an essay or a novel?: This book was given to me as a gift, I was excited to read it as I'm a big fan of detective series novels. Unfortunately, I won't be reading any more Warshawski novels, in fact, I didn't finish this one. This book seemed to be a political essay thinly veiled as a third rate murder mystery. Regardless of your political views, I can't see how this book could be taken seriously. The story line was weak, the characters thin, and the writing was tedious.
__label__2 A worthwhile challenge to any lover of Dickey's writing: Anyone expecting another book like Deliverance will be vastly disappointed. I struggled with this book at first yet I found it had many rewards not offered up by the usual "top ten" hits list of today's pop pulp market. While Dickey fails where someone like Umberto Eco might succeed it is worthwhile to hitch a ride on Dickey's powerful imagination and tough muscular illusory prose. You almost believe a blind man can fly! I'm a sucker for Dickey so became immersed in this book and liked it better than the White Sea which came later and which I found a good cure for insomnia. While Alnilam did not initially "knock me out", I find it staying with me all these years later.
__label__2 One of the Best Ever! Awesome!!!: There are a few albums that I own that I absolutely love - you know: "Albums-you'd-take-with-you-if-you-were-going-to-be-stranded-on-a-desert-island" -type. Yes, it is THAT good! It rocks from beginning to end. Sure, there's ballads included, but they "fit" in with the rest of the album - no need to ever skip any tracks."Attitude" was an appropriate title for this album as they definitely had it going on here.I was highly disappointed when I bought "Frigate" after this album - hoping for "Attitude 2" but it didn't match up for me no where near. I've read the raving reviews for "Frigate", I don't know, maybe I'll have to go back and give it another chance after all these years.Anyway, buy "Attitude", you won't be disappointed!
__label__2 good product: If you're buying this for the first time, I guess it sucks to be you right now. This product works great and the seller is as good. Just remember that the only 3 things you now control are; what you eat, when you test and how often you exercise, so get your head around the new normal
__label__2 great: My huband and i both use this product and at the store they a very high. Great price and very easy to get.
__label__2 Good: Exactly what we wanted at a very good price. Shipping was fast and everything went accordingly to expectations. Only complain was there weren't any more.
__label__2 Amazing!: You know who lead Toad. This is a near perfect album.When I re-discovered it, it was the perfect moment for me and the lyrics and emotion are profound. Thanks Glen!
__label__2 A Must Have For Any Music Lover: Winter Pays For Summer is a must have for any music lover. Glen Phillips has captured the art of living in the modern world through his brilliant song writing. From sing out loud with the windows rolled down songs like Finally Fading, Falling and Cleareyed to the haunting, beautiful Released, the voice of Toad the Wet Sprocket has grown up, and we are all the better for it.
__label__2 Exciting Album From Glen's Solo Career: I'm a long time Toad fan and have followed Glen's solo career ever since the breakup. I'm no good at reviews, so all I will do is what I do best when I like something; really like something - GUSH. This album is fun, deep and everything that you can expect from a very talented musician and songwriter. Hooray!
__label__2 sony sb-v40s av selector: I had a similar item to this that I had purchased awhile ago, but it was more of a pain than a convenience. This is easy to use.
__label__2 a pretty good buy: The games in this book require few props, which is one reason i like it. However there are many numerical and verbal exercises which might not be suitable for all groups. The games are well classified and easy to find in the book. The ones on creative thinking, learning and communication are particularly good. I work with students and have used many of the games with success. This book can be used for any type of audience, overall it is a pretty good buy.
__label__2 excellent career guide for women: I found the book a useful guide to exploring options - how to find them and how to make the best choices - it offers new perspectives on career directions for women - have shared it with many of my friends - a great "gift" to anyone facing change
__label__1 Very dissatisfied: After reading the many positive reviews about this 'phone, I bought one. But...it's terrible. From the start, it constantly cuts out while in use, even though the base is less than 4 feet away.
__label__2 so far so good: We needed a new phone to replace a very old portable and we chose this model based upon reviews, features and price. I've had it about a month and so far am very happy with the phone. It's easy to use, and has great reception. The big test will be how it holds up, and whether it keeps a charge after a year or so. I have Vtech phones that are no more than 2 years old and don't hold a charge at all. I am definitely considering replacing those with additional ones like this.
__label__1 There are many other good books on this topic - avoid this one: I was dissapointed with this book for a number of reasons:1. Way too much fluff. The material in this book could have been provided in a couple of chapters. The book is filled with a lot of unnecessary filler that does not serve to improve the reader's understanding of training with a heart rate monitor.2. The basics of heart rate training was repeated over and over again without telling the reader significantly more or new information.3. This book contains so many careless typos I felt like I was reading an early draft copy of a mauscript prior to submission to an editor.I don't doubt that the author is knowledgeable on this topic since she has a number of other heart rate training related books. However this one appears to have been rushed to press in an incomplete form and is one to avoid.
__label__2 little gem from a bygone era: The book is an interesting short review of North Carolina's lighthouses and the illustrations are amazing and that is not just because my Dad did them!!!!
__label__2 The MBA admisssions bible!: This book is a must have if you are applying to business schools. It worked like a charm.
__label__1 Beware: one of the worst set of computer games ever: The description of the game is great, it makes you want to buy it. Do not let the advertising trick you. The games are very poorly designed, bad graphics. Most games are from the early 90's. I contacted the manufacurer after I installed the games and requested an explanation on why they sell old games as brand new, never got an answer. A waste of money!
__label__2 Porter-Cable Air Floor Nailer: I am very satisfied with this product. I read the other reviews before purchasing this nailer. I put down approximately 600 square feet of flooring and used 3000 cleat nails. The "last nail" syndrome ruined a couple of pieces of flooring but you learn to watch how many nails you have left and refill appropriately. Good product and highly recommend it to other potential customers.
__label__2 The Best No. 4 I've Ever Heard: Tchaikovsky's 4th is one of my favorite symphonies and I own many versions. I've heard many more versions performed in person or on the radio. This one is the sine qua non of all versions. It's the best hands down. There's no need to look further. This is the one you should buy. The phrasing and tempos are done very sensitively--pure poetry. The sound is incredible with great clarity. No one section drowns out another. Every instrument can be heard all at once! Most importantly, the musicality is transcendent. Some notes seem to contain multiple dimensions--whole new worlds contained in one note. I'm not kidding! This is an incredible performance. Also featured on the disk is the often-heard "Romeo and Juliet" overture. While it's quite good, it's not the best version I've heard, but that's OK...I consider the overture as an added bonus.
__label__2 Great case!: Love the case great for my new little camera the protection on the side works great-especially when your sons pulls the camera from your purse and drops it when you have only had it a few weeks.
__label__1 Should be called Sub-Basic: Very disappointed in this product... for this price, I expected more. There is no accompanying booklet to the lessons, forcing you to constantly pause to take notes on vocabulary, etc. The "lessons" are just the alphabet, numbers, time, question words, etc., without any useful examples to put them into sentences or any kind of context. Test material is also poor, not really helping to reinforce what was presented. All the material on this DVD is easily available on the internet (including pronunciations), so what's the point?
__label__1 not worth your dime: The maker of this DVD series has no idea whatsoever about teaching and learning process...The material is lacking in almost every aspect. What is the point of making dvd if you are going to read the text on the screen, there are no dialogues just plain monologues, no interaction,no booklet...Stay away from this material. Its a total waste of money. The Philippine presentation was pictures scanned from postcards not even actual photos taken by the makers of this dvd.
__label__2 Sharp and overall good: Decent quality chisels. The handles seem comfortable to grip and they have held up well. I have purchased two kits, one that I have used for a long time and the other I gave a Christmas present. Quite pleased for the price.
__label__2 Great Product!: I bought this product specifically for my husband to keep in touch with me and the kids when he is out of town. It was very easy to install and is very user-friendly. My husband isn't very comfortable with new technology, but he was able to figure out how to use it with little confusion and frustration. I plan to buy another pack for my Mom and best friend, so we can all keep in touch!!
__label__2 Just what we ordered: These cameras are being used in an environment for lots of people to share and to learn about video communication. So far, they are durable, and work just as advertised. I would definitely buy them again.
__label__1 A good book!!!!!!!!???????: The part on calculating inductances (gap, slot and end)that covers from pages 94 is totally wrong. The formula for slot reacatance has been copied from induction motor design books where the locations of the coils are different from induction motors with double layer windings. In addition because in PM motors the winding is always fractional slot, we cannot find a slot with both coil sides from the same phase; the writer has forgotten to include a factor to consider that the coil sides in the same slot belong to different phases.An accurate reader can easily find mistakes in all chapters.
__label__1 Great Movie DVD not worth the wait!: I love this movie ehough that I few years ago I bought a great used copy of a VHS for $15.And after all this time what to get with a DVD well a copy that looks about as good as the DVD I burned a few years ago that is in ;get this, MONO!I have a Hi-Fi stereo version and this soundtrack sounds worst.Also no extras at all just a nice picture on the DVD back cover of Corinne Alphen that is not on the original VHS and the film trailer.This all has to do with music rights and because there are a few songs by bands such as NRBQ and .38 Special and you can't transfer music rights from one format to another without getting someone to sign off, a crappy mono verison of the DVD is allowed to be released.The one good thing about this DVD is that it is widescreen format and that is the only choice.The same thing for the Hardbodies collection just released also.
__label__1 I had to get rid of this CD: I cannot imagine a more sloppy recording of these two masterpieces. I had to get rid of the CD after the first hearing - it was simply too embarrassing to have in my collection.For the Nielsen Concerto go to Emil Telmanyi and the Royal Orchestra conducted by Tango on Danacord. The Sibelius has several good recordings, my favourite is Ferras with the BPO and Karajan (Sibelius himself said about Karajan that he was the only conductor who really understood his music).
__label__1 Pehaps the worst guide book ever written: I understand that it's difficult to top The Ultimate Kauai Guidebook, but this book reads like whole passages were lifted from that much better volume. What appears to be original reads like it was written by 15-year-olds, and is mostly just naive drivel. Don't waste your time or money.
__label__2 I really liked the price. Perfect quality.: This product is the same as over the counter or by Rx. at a much cheaper price. I will continue to purchase the lancets from you.
__label__1 Incompatible with OneTouch Ultra Mini: I suppose I am in a similar situation with many others who ordered this product. The description implies "Compatible with LifeScan and most other blood sampling devices" but in reality it isn't compatible with my OneTouch Ultra Mini. I'm going to request a return authorization and credit to my Visa account. If that doesn't work I'll have Visa initiate a hold/challenge and we'll see what happens.
__label__1 Did not last long: We purchased this mobile a few weeks before our son was born. He loved the mobile for the one month that it worked. Like someone else in these reviews, it just quit. We replaced the batteries and the music would play, but the mobile wouldn't turn. That doesn't do us much good at all. The unit has a wire that runs through from the bottom to a motor at the top where it spins.... this motor on top seems to be the problem. The company must have a problem with their motors or something, but I would not recommend buying this unit due to the fact it doesn't last long.
__label__1 very disappointed: We have now been through two of these. I will return the second today. With the first one, it would only play music after the first day. There was no motion. With the second-- the mobile portion has fallen in the crib three times. Fortunately my son was not in the crib when it did this. At first I thought it was because I assembled it incorrectly, but it is just faulty. I will return it today and will not get a new one.
__label__2 Absolutely Priceless!: First of all, the remote is a GODSEND. I can be across the room, and the mobile will stop, and I just press which composer I'd like my daughter to listen to, and it starts up again for another 15 minutes of music. The music is beautiful... MUCH better than all the others on the market. My daughter just ADORES this mobile to pieces. There's always something going on, and the colors are so bright and interesting! I would buy this again in less than a heartbeat and wouldn't recommend anything else!!! You won't EVER regret this one!
__label__1 Try another one: My baby liked this mobile but unfortunately it broke after a couple weeks and would no longer spin. It now only plays music intermittently even with the battery changes. It was a gift so we had no receipt and unfortunatley threw away the box so the store would not take it back. I see from other reviews that people are having similar problems. Try your luck or try another mobile.
__label__1 Dangerous product!: We read all the good reviews this mobile got and decided to buy it. But it was terrible. When it spins, plastic pieces slide down the arms making an annoying noise that won't let the baby sleep. But worst of all the construction is flimsy! The head portion easily detaches and falls into the crib. Once it happened we quickly returned it and got the Sassy Mobile which we love.
__label__2 exceeds expectations: My babies love love love this mobile. I'm really impressed with the design - the movements work with gravity and help develop understanding about how things move and interact. I have twins and it amazes me how long one will happily lie there watching the mobile while I take care of the other. The design is great - one of the twins managed to get hold of the elephant and put it in her mouth and the mobile just swung around and coped with the problem until I got it away from her. (This was because I was helping them both sit up and watch it - they just love it so much.)
__label__1 Great mobile, lousy quality: It's a beautiful mobile, and really well designed to interest the baby. Unfortunately, the build quality is terrible. We're currently on our third mobile... and this one just stopped working as well. It's not that we're using it too heavily, either. We use it perhaps one hour a week.
__label__1 Motor never worked.: We received this as a gift, set it up, got the music playing, but the motor never worked.
__label__2 Great! So Cute!: My son LOVED this! He would lay in his crib and watch it for such a long time! He was so enthralled by the bright colors and music! He is 3 years old now, but from birth to about 9 months old he had this in his crib. I took it down once he could pull himself up and tug at it. These make great gifts too! I wish I would have had one in his bassinet too!
__label__2 The Most Fun for Your Baby: I bought this mobile after my 10-week-old noticed the one her cousin had from across the room. When I got it home she went absolutely wild watching her little animal friends and listening to the music. It's adorable to see and hear her shrieking and wiggling happily for loooong stretches of time - at least enough for me to get a few things done around the house. The only problem is that the first mobile I bought developed a loud squeak after about 2 weeks and stopped turning after about 4 weeks. Frtunately, Babies R Us is great with returns and exchanged it for me. No problems with the new one so far after about one month of use. This mobile is one of the best things we bought for our baby.
__label__2 Best purchase for our baby!!!: This is actually our second mobile (exact same one). The first one I purchased and it just quit about three weeks ago...couldn't ever figure out why so we made a mad dash to the local Toys R Us who was sold out. Ended up having to order online because our little guy couldn't be without this mobile - he absolutely loves it!!! While we were waiting for this one to arrive, I had to stand there and mimic the mobile's movements for my son b/c he just loves it so much! The music is soothing, the colors of the animals are great and constant motion of the beads keeps my baby entertained. He just loves it and it guarantees me 15 minutes of free time and most days a second 15 minutes with the quick hit of the remote control button. Great mobile - would highly recommend!
__label__1 not worth the money: While my daughter really enjoyed looking at this mobile, it is cheaply made, and I can't believe they charge [item price] for it. The head part never really attached very securely and fell off into the crib quite a few times. At 3 1/2 months it came off, and would not stay back on at all, so I had to throw it away. The spinning part also stopped spinning at this point. It also used batteries like crazy. We only really used it like once or twice a day for 10 or so minutes, and we were changing the batteries every few days.I would not recommend this product at all unless they get a clue and construct it better!
__label__2 Very Stimulating!: I bought this for my daughter when she was 5 weeks old. SHE LOVES IT!! The second I put her under it, she started squeeling and smiling! The mobile doesn't even have to be on and it entertains her!
__label__2 My Baby's "Friends"...: We have the Ocean Wonders Aquarium, the Dreamscapes Soother, a play gym on one side of the crib and the Deluxe Symphony mobile. Out of all those busy little baby contraptions that we have hooked up to my baby's crib, the only thing he is interested in is the mobile! Once we put him in, the first thing that he smiles at are his "friends", he can care less of all the others! He talks to the mobile and kicks and tries to grab them. The music plays for about 15 minutes, and even if it stops and my baby is still playing, we just click on the remote. The only drawback is that when you turn on the mobile and want to use the remote, you have to press the button on the base itself (reaching over and having baby SEE you and want to get picked up). Also, it does eat up batteries, so stock up on those AA batteries! But I think it's well worth it for the enjoyment my baby gets out of it!
__label__1 It didn't work: We purchased this mobile after our whoozit mobile broke. This one was so interesting turning in motion in several different ways. ONLY THE MOTOR WOULD NOT WORK!!. Also it seems very dangerous for the arm. I feel it could fall out very easily. My baby loved to look at the strong contrast too bad it never worked.
__label__2 Sony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones: I wanted headphones with a substantial connecting cord of a decent length. These headphones fill that bill easily. The cord is over 6 feet in length has a connector that will mesh with a devices from audio equipment to IPods with the micro-plug. I liked the versatility.For audiophiles, the sound is rich in bass and has crisp tones. The ear cups cover the ear blocking any outside sounds from intruding into your music or audiobook.The price is right for a real bargain in headphones.
__label__2 Great bargain, great product: These headphones are a tremendous steal for under $15. I've been a loyal Sony Headphone user since I bought my first Walkman, oh so many moons ago.These headphones won't give you a neckache (like heavier models), the sound quality is great, and the design allows for hours of comfortable wear.One downside - the length of the cord seems a little long - for the average user (using these for a portable device or laptop) will find that there are a few feet of cord to spare. Since the cord is rubberized, thus less likely to fold away easily, it does tend to get in the way.
__label__2 Excellently durable: Technically, this is just a replacement (I hope) to the one I already have, but I've been very impressed with them. They've held up to a decade of abuse and still work pretty decently. The only thing I caution is don't let the cords around the earbuds and the cord leading to the 2.5/3.5mm jack get tangled or curled. It's a pain in the rear to try to straighten them out. This is why I am buying a replacement. However, all in all they are still worth the money paid.Though, if you're like me, you're probably gonna want to go with "cordless" at some point, but these are good for keeping outside noise out while you listen and drift away with the music. :)
__label__1 Good While They Lasted: I bought these headphones in September of 2007, they lasted until June of 2009.The plastic "U" that attaches the headpiece to the side cup cracked so now the left ear-cup is detached and dangling.I hate to throw things out but they finally bit the dust after two years.RIP Sony Studio Headphones, 06/05/2009
__label__1 so uncomfortable they hurt my ears: can't wear them for more than about a half hour w/ my ears starting to hurt. Terrible. Sound quality is ok, but they feel on my ears is terrible.
__label__1 We had two and they broke easily: We have two of these headphones that I am in the process of throwing in the trash. They were only used a few times when a little plastic tab on the piece between the earpiece and the "headband" broke. Now the earpieces will not lay flat against your ear and they cannot be used. I expected better quality from Sony.
__label__1 They're okay for the price.: I purchased a new pair from best buy and I rarely used them. I find out that the plastic covering on the ear padding is peeling off into my ear. So my face is covered in black pieces of plastic. I had hardly even used them. On that point, it makes them unusable unless you're going to shower right after or risk walking around with black pieces of plastic all over your face. Right now I'm trying to pick off all the outer coating so I can finally use them.
__label__2 Best affordable headphones out there: Got mine during Thanksgiving Sale for $9! Definitely worth my money. After months of constant use and harsh handling (I often drop them), it still works as great as the first time I bought them.
__label__1 too tight: partially my own fault though, should have anticipated that such an earphone would be tight.
__label__1 Great in some respects, mediocre in others: I had problems with one of these units (left ear piece stopped working after a mere 15 minutes of use), but ultimately got a replacement and bought and additional one and both are fine. The ear pads are exceptionally comfortable, but the head piece is poorly designed and digs into your head above your ears. As for audio quality, well, you get what you pay for, but it's not too bad. Not audiophile, but great for use on a computer.
__label__2 Good headphone, may have too much bass: It has way more bass and sounds warmer than other headphones I have, since I need a more true-sound headphone for recording & editing purposes. But for other purposes, it may be perfect.
__label__1 These hurt your ears: I really don't mind these headphones except for one thing- THEY HURT. My ears start hurting after less than an hour of use. These sit directly on top of your ears, not around them. Also, for someone with a big head (like me), they are a really tight fit.For $15, you are getting what you pay for, but there are certainly better headphones on the market. I don't recommend these.
__label__1 Boomy Bass: I was so excited to get this Sony headphones at only [...] with free shipping. It looked well made considering the cost and comfortable on my ears. But when it comes to the sound quality, I can not say I agree with the most other reviews here. I'm wondering how the others can leave such good reviews. The most unfavorable thing isit has egaggerated bass. So boomy that you can not here the exact sound of the original recording. I tried to give some break in times but after 3 days of trying, I gave up and returning this poor headphones back to Amazon. Thank you Amazon for your easy way of returning.
__label__1 Ouch!: These are really tight!Delivers good bass, but sound is lacking on the high end.Construction is up to Sony's usual high standards.
__label__2 Great headphones: I found the reviews for these headphones helpful. I'm not technical, don't understand anything about specs, I'm just a music lover and I trusted one of the reviewers (also figured it's just $14, so where's the risk?).GREAT HEADPHONES! Great sound--far superior to ear buds. They're also comfortable. No, they're not great for running, but I use them when at work, sitting in front of a computer all day. I also can't stand the idea of putting ear buds into my ears--that's just gross.
__label__2 Awesome for such a low price.: If you want better sound than the crappy earphones or headphones that came with your CD/MP3/MD player, get these. They're high in value. Although not the best, they are still great.
__label__1 Cheap, low quality headphones: I don't write reviews regularly, but I was so unhappy with this product that I felt I should. The only reason I wanted to buy a headphone was to listen to music while working on my laptop, without disturbing other people around me. This headphone is rediculous, as even at the lowest volume set, others in the room can hear the music too! Isn't it the whole purpose of headphone to keep the sound only to YOUR ears, not others? It is extremely uncomfortable on the head too, although the ear pads are relatively comfortable. The sound quality is just ok. I wish I had spent a bit more money and had bought a better quality headphones. This product ranks #1 on the list of my worst purchases for 2008!
__label__1 Viselike: I purchased these about a year ago, and yes they sound really great. Although there is one major drawback. I believe that an "Asian" developed them, because they are the most "uncomfortable" headphones I've ever used in my life. An asian with a considerably smaller head, because these feel like a VISE around your ears. Did I mention that they will give you one heck of a "headache" too? I'm trying to warn anyone to not purchase these since there are many more alternatives out there. And I by no means have an oversized head! Check out my "other" reviews, since I feel like I'm a very fair man. I just don't want anyone else to make a poor purchase one these!
__label__1 Decent build, mediocre sound: These headphones are reasonably comfortable, though if you wear eyeglasses you might find them pressing your glasses against the side of your head in an eventually painful way.The sound quality is mediocre. Music seems too dead, lacking vibrance. Even Sony's basic $10 comes-with-the-walkman headphones sound better than these.Overall, these are probably fine for background music whilst working, but if you want to really listen and pay attention to the music, try something else.
__label__1 These are awful!: Had two pairs before, and stupidly bought yet another pair when the previous ones finally broke for good on me. The first pair broke constantly, even after repeated attempts at supergluing them back together(they broke along the small plastic pieces holding the headphones onto the band), and I was wearing the second pair when I accidentally got up and knelt on the cord, so that the headphone jack ripped out of the cord completely and nearly got stuck in my iPod(yes, I realise that one was my fault).This pair is my last one from Sony, I've only had them since March, and already they're breaking down so that unless I position the cord exactly right, the sound cuts in and out(sometimes I can hear the music, but no vocals, and sometimes vice versa), and on occasion it cuts out entirely. Just not worth it for the price I paid for them, I'll be looking for a different pair after this.
__label__2 Excellent for the price: I'm very pleased with this purchase. I considered new headphones for months, before needing to make a quick purchase. I went for the value and have been impressed. I do agree with the folks that the headphones are a bit tight, but not uncomfortable. If you're looking to wear them for more than an hour at a time, go for something that fits around the ear.
__label__2 Good doesn't have to be expensive: These are great. I use them all the time for monitoring when recording. I'm sure there are some better cans out there, but I've found these to be really solid, balanced, and true. The only thing bad about them is after several years of use, the leather-like covers on the earphones are flaking off (though the foam underneath is still fine). So I'm going to buy a new pair. They have a nice long cord, and you can wear them comfortably for a long, long time. They're light but sturdy.
__label__2 ill never understand why people pay so much for headphones.: for $15 this is nuts. they dont block out sound, and the cable is a little too long, but these are just great headphones, had em for a long time, havent given me 1 bit of trouble.
__label__1 Uncomfortable, Poor Sound, Buy something else: These headphones are cheap plastic, too tight, uncomfortable and the sound quality is terrible. Yes, they were only $20, but there must be better options for this price. They are NOT studio quality "Monitor" headphones. The one good thing is that the plug is small and fits an iPhone in a case or bumper. Get something else.
__label__2 My favorite Risk by far!: If I ever want to play Risk, this is what I bring to the table. I like it that this has a limited number of rounds and doesn't go for complete global domination. No more games until the wee hours of the morning while you're twiddling your thumbs eliminated and the last two players duke it out for complete domination. However, this game can still take quite a long time even for 5 rounds.What I like most about this game is the commanders and the command cards. They really add a lot of nice variety to the game when it comes to planning your strategy. I also like the "feel" of multiple battlefronts with the added moon and water colonies.More options... More decisions...More variety.
__label__2 Pee in Your Pants Funny: You know how you always think things in your head, but don't say them out loud...this mom writer does just that! This book is hysterical and just what busy, stressed out moms need after a hard day being mommy. I loved it!!!
__label__1 Worked Great for 2 Days: I bought this because my son's formula is so hard to mix. It worked great for only two days and then died. It is not worth the money.
__label__1 HORRIBLE!: We would of given this a zero if we had the choice. So it got one star from us. We watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and we still can't get over this trash. I also broke the disc in half. I wanted to crawl under a rock when the sex scenes came on and we were watching it with my 13yr. old son. WARNING WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.
__label__1 should have 'X' rating: This is just porn with a spiritual tag. The acting is laughable and the plot has nothing to do with the rapture. Even the $5.97 price was a waste of money.
__label__1 THE RAPTURE: THIS WAS THE WRONG MOVIE1 IT WAS SENT TO A FRIEND AS A GIFT AND THEY WERE NOT PLEASED. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A CHRISTIAN MOVIE AND THIS WAS NOT IT1
__label__1 Warning not a clean movie..: Warning title deceptive....movie description: The acclaimed file the rapture is a sexual and spiritual awakening... a beautiful telephone oprator seeks excitement in orgiastic sex with strangers.. tormented by feelings of emptiness attempts suicide. A hallucinatory religious conversion from a cult-like religion preparing for the rapture...frightening and ultimately tragic. Picture on front is deceptive also.
__label__1 ANTI CHRISTIAN PROPAGANDA!!!!: I think I would be offering a valuable public service if I would announce to all of you that this movie is a bigoted, narrow minded slurr against Christians and the Bible (i.e. the message is that all people of faith are mentaly ill and brainwashed maniacs) This movie mocks God, Christ, and people who profess to have faith in the Bible. It makes all people of faith to be nothing more than silly idiots who are insane and cannot have rational normal thoughts or actions. I saw no redeeming value in the twisted, biased, and comic-book parody of end-time Biblical prophecy. Do not be misled by the title of this film. This movie contains perverted sex scenes, nudity, and violence. If this movie had stereotyped any other group or class of people as it has done Christians it would be banned and the people who made it forced to make an apology. It's TRASH!!!
__label__1 so stupid: this movie is a total waste of time. I actually took it out of the dvd and threw it away. PLease do not waste your money!
__label__1 didnt like it: terriable movies ,,, grose this movie didnt have anything to do with the rapture to much sex in it ,, it was bad
__label__2 fine for its time: These phones are compatible with the Panasonic cordless answering machine system, KX-TG2730. I have used this for about 3 years and overall it is a good phone. Battery life is low and the construction is somewhat flimsy (if you drop the phone, everything will go flying).
__label__1 piece of #$*&: what junk. save your money and don't buy this product. had it only a year and it broke. total crap
__label__2 Can't complain: I bought this unit at Sam's about a year ago. I am surprised by the reviews. I have had this for about a year with no problems. I haven't noticed it being noisy, but this is the first wine cooler I've bought so I have nothing to compare to. If there is a power outage - it does default back the the 45 degree setting (white wine), but since it has a digital read-out on the front, it hasn't been a problem for me press the button to reset it back to the red wine preset.It keeps my wine cool and we can easily grab a bottle and open it at night for dinner. I'm happy with it.
__label__1 There is so much interference you can barely hear: Plain and simple: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT; IT IS HORRIBLE!!!YOU CANT HEAR ANYTHING
__label__1 What a piece of junk. I returned mine.: We have a Bose surround sound system in our house but the speaker range leaves some dead spots around the house so the Sony wireless speakers seemed to be the ideal solution. Unfortunately when I unpacked and set up the speakers they continuously hissed very loudly no matter how many times I moved the receiver or changed the channels. I actually did get them to work once for about 15 mins but the speakers were hissing loudly the entire time. After about 15 minutes the sound completely faded to total static. I read the other Amazon reviews which were not favorable before I purchased this product and I wish I had listened. Amazon was wonderful about returning them. DONT BUY THIS SPEAKER!!!
__label__1 Boring!: A poker game with rules I can't understand. Invisible creatures destroying Deep Space Nine. How bad can you get?
__label__2 An unusual memoir by a remarkable Jewish scholar: This small book covers an enormous range of subjects. Chasidic life in a shtetyl, the Holocaust, conflict within the Jewish institutions of higher learning in post war America, the personal psychological impact of being a Holocaust survivor, and the various modes of Talmudic scholarship - Halivin's great accomplishment is to bring meaning to this wide spectrum of topics in few words. This is a book by a serious thinker who is not afraid to risk revealing his innermost feelings and conflicts. A courageous work
__label__1 Requires a video signal: I wanted to use this to switch between different audio sources and the occasional video source. The problem is that like most other switchers, this requires a video signal to work. Great if you always have that, but for me ... not so great.
__label__1 Blown Pump Head: Let say first that the pressure washer was easy to assemble, oil, and begin using. It is small enough to move around easily and has more than enough power.And that leads to my problems with this unit. I used it one weekend with excellent results. The next weekend I had it up and running for an hour when the pump head blew off the unit while I was spraying. I found parts 25 yards away. I have a brother who works in the small engine field and I ask him about it and showed him the pump head. He asked if the unit had a Honda engine and when I said yes, he said there is the problem. Honda engines are not run for initial break in before they are mated with the pump. Once the engine is run a couple of hours, it develops higher RPMs and greater pressure. He has replaced more than a few pump heads, and even replaced more than one on the same pressure washer. He has also called the manufacturer and reported the problem.
__label__1 Built To Not Too Thrilled: I love BTS and almost everything they've put out, but when I first listend to Ultimate AW I had to check that I had the right CD. This is nothing like the rest of their music and should defintely not be the first BTS you listen to becuase it will probably turn you off. I think they got a little too experimental with this and deviated from what was working (out of boredom maybe). Whatever the reason, Ultimate Alt is really lacking that awesome, unique BTS sound that is otherwise consitent in their other CDs. If you're looking for some great Built To Spill, check out Keep It Like A Secret, Perfect From Now On, or Nothing Wrong With Love.
__label__2 Great Product: The dumbbell is well made, very sturdy and it is very easy to change the weight amount but I failed to read closely that the weight is only adjustable in increments of 10 lbs only; 10 lbs, 20 lbs, and so forth, up to 50 lbs. It would be nice to be able to have a 5 lb adjustment available to set the weight amounts in 5 lb increments; 15 lbs, 25 lbs, 35 lbs, etc, similar to the 25 lbs adjustable dumbbell Bayou offers. I would recommend this product for anyone interested in an adjustable dumbbell.
__label__2 Good Series: I am very pleased with this series of commentaries. They have done a great job of both exegesis and hermeneutics. This particular commentary in Acts meets the high standard of the series.
__label__1 cute bear, but womb sounds broke down: We were given this as a gift and within a week or two the womb sounds machine was broken. It will only play for about 30 seconds. I can't return it as it was a gift.As a teddy bear, it's very cute and cuddly, and my son loves it, but if you're buying it for the sounds machine then don't bother. We ended up pulling out the machine and stitching the bear back up so it can be a regular teddy bear.
__label__1 Different from the pictured bear: I was looking to purchase a "backup" bear for the Melodies Gund Bear that my son is currently using. I tried first at my local stores, but they all have the newer version of the bear. Different texture "fur", different color eyes, no bow but instead has a "tattooed" paw and not as stuffed. I purchased this one from Amazon because the bear pictured is the same bear that my son owns. Fingers crossed, I placed my order and waited for the bear to show up. It arrived on time so no complaints - I was quite happy...until I opened the box. What?! It was the newer version of the Gund Bear. The bear in itself is great. The melodies are sweet and the 3 levels of volume are fantastic. The duration (approx. 15 mins) is more than enough to soothe your child. The bear is a great purchase if, IF, this is your first melodies bear but not if you are looking to replace your child's current gund bear (older version pictured).
__label__2 enormous bowl: I bought this bowl hoping to use it as a serving dish for my family. Maybe I missed the measurements somewhere. I could put enough food for 10-20 people. Very large. I kept it using it as fruit bowl on my counter. Even then it is BIG! It does look nice clean lines. If you need BIG this is it.
__label__2 A fun, lighthearted book!: I loved reading this book. It's a bit above my age-level, but heck! I have been reading TB's for seven years! That's a hard habit to break! Anyway, back to this book. Ashleigh is such a fun character who finds some way to get into trouble at every turn! What did she do now? Bought a racehorse with her father's bidding card!
__label__2 A wonderful recording: This is a delightful recording of one of an absolutely stunning piece of music. I am not a music critic, so I'll leave it at that.
__label__1 bonita musica pero muy ligera: Fue un grupo que gozo de buena popularidad a pesar de que sus interpretaciones no eran nada del otro mundo ,arreglos muy ligeros y planos,pero bueno hay que destacar que adornaron una epoca de oro del pop espanoly contribuyeron a que esta musica fuera mas bella.regardsjose
__label__2 About this version of the KJV Apocrypha...: Easy to read typeset...two-column pages...very nicely bound.This is an interesting addition to your religious reference library.
__label__2 Should be seen and discussed by all Christians: This documentary is about a Church with a vision they are convinced is from God. At least their pastor thinks so and convinces his congregation to get on board. As the story progresses we start to see how severely deluded this vision is. The filmmaker did not try to make these people look foolish. He lets them tell their own story. The Church has some extremely likeable people including the Pastor who guides them. They are very sincere people and are geniune Christians devoted to God. As things begin to unravel for them, you wonder why God did not intervene in some way. I think this is an important film that needs to be seen and discussed by Christians in small groups. It would be an ideal place to begin a discussion on "Is that voice we hear really from God?" or a hundred other topics of people attempting to serve their Creator. Highly recommended.
__label__1 Disappointed: I am disappointed with this product. Only 6 of the 9 led's light up, even after the recommended 8 hour charge. The light will not run off the charger and the battery compartment is difficult (impossible) to open. I do not recomment this product and hope to return it to AMAZON for a full refund. Because of this bad experience, I am unlikely to purchase any SIMA products in the future.
__label__1 didn't dissolve: We used the gelpacks a few times & they never completely dissolved in the dispenser - just turned into a gooey mess. We use the tablets with the 'powerball' & are pleased with them.
__label__2 beautiful coat, quality, cut, color..... 5 stars: Bought as a gift. I can't say enough how beautiful this coat was... unfortunitly, the petite size 6 runs small. We had to return for a regular 6.

__label__1 slow and boring. refund please: The dreariness of this movie made us want to take some pills and turn on the gas. We can't believe we watched it to the end! This was, yes I said was, our date night movie, a real mood enhancer, pass the bottle of pills!
__label__1 borring!: Slow and pointless. I could not sit still and watch it. It took me three days. I paid for it, so I had to Finnish it but it was torture.
__label__1 Read at your own risk!: This book is not only badly written, it is an example of the dangers of cult-recruiting preying on those who may be young, lost, and searching. Since this edition predicts that the world as we know it will end in May 2001, it will be interesting to see if a new edition comes out which moves the day of doom ahead so that this cult guru can continue to collect on other people's hard-earned income.Even just as an intellectual exercise, this book holds no value. The storyline is choppy and holds no continuity. The author goes in and out of predicting the future and self-glorification. Save your money.
__label__2 A wonderful inspiring book!: Tom Lambke creates an excellent piece that documents the journey of his son to become a Special Olympian gold medalist. There is no pity or helplessness in this book; it is simply a joyous celebration of his son's life and accomplishments.
__label__2 I suppose...: ...it works...In order to really see a difference you would have to take it consistently every day, which I don't because I'm forgetful. I personally didn't notice much of a difference, but try it for yourself. It can't hurt.
__label__2 All in all, a good introduction tool to rotational molding.: I found this book to be packed with good information that was easy to follow. It is a great tool for those new to rotational molding.
__label__2 whats next: this show has it all, comedy , heartbreak , romance . TALENT BEYOND COMPARE! Can't wait for season two I cant imagine it getting better, but i know it does
__label__2 Like the songs, don't like the agenda: Great showtunes, most original, great acting, writing and story-line. However, I hate the liberal agenda this show develops over the season.
__label__2 Smash is a smash: I really like this CD but I am worried there won't be another. There are other songs I would have chosen to be on this album but I like it just the same. I am waiting for Season 1 to come out on DVD.
__label__2 Civil War Songbook: This is a great book. I really appreciate the guitar chords written above the music and the simplicity of how the music is written so that anyone can play it even the novice. I enjoy the historical comments too as I have learned history I did not know before.
__label__2 Civil War Songbook by Keith and Rusty McNeil: After reviewing Keith and Rusty's Civil War Songbook, I am impressed. Each song has a description of the song with events that pertain to the song. Although the music is just the melody line with the words it is fine to get an idea of how the song sounded. This book may not be for everyone, but it was just what I was looking for.
__label__2 So confusing: I love this camera, except that the version I have is an AKAI DS8341. I wonder how many other companies have sold the exact same camera.
__label__2 Good, mystery with strong character development: This was a good, mystery with a sad, lead character development. While the plot is intriguing and capturing, the writer uses sub plots which are part of the downside of our social times such as obsessive compulsive disorder and poor parental actions.
__label__1 Thin on Plot, Wayyyyy Too Much Souling Searching: I found this book to be tedious and slow. The legal portions were elementary and obvious and nothing much really happens. The "twist" or "reveal" at the end was telegraphed from the next state. The final dramatic culimating scene near the end was tedious and comical. Half the book is about the emotional state of the lawyer, the protagonist or the victims. I didn't care!!Gave it one extra star because it was free. But this one (seriously!) made me question my due diligence method of downloading free books. I guess that's something.
__label__1 A disappointment: I think the writer was more concerned with producing a book with lots of pages instead of quality. There were certain parts of the book that was just painful to read (especially the scene with Miggy).Could have been a good book if it wasn't for all the dribble.
__label__2 Hostile Witness: I really enjoyed this book by Rebecca Forster. So much, I bought three more of her books. I recommend any mystery/thriller readers try it. I will be buying more of her books.
__label__2 Enjoyable read.: This is a fine legal thriller with plenty of twists and turns. If you like this genre, you are almost certain to like this tale. Take notice of the large number of reviews and the consistently high ratings. That many people are unlikely to have been wrong. Also, this book is still free. It's hard to see how most readers could go wrong trying this book.
__label__2 So Good: This book will pull you in from the beginning. I didn't have it figured out till the very end, and even then I was shocked.
__label__2 Excellent Story: This book really grabs you from the beginning. It bogs down a little in the middle and may be slightly predictable, but it is so well written, you just have to finish the book.
__label__2 Hostile Witness: This is my first book for this author. I really enjoyed its pace and plot. It kept me going back. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller!!
__label__2 hooked: This novel is good from the start, I was unable to put this book down, it kept me at the edge of my seat. Good writing
__label__2 Hostile Witness: I enjoyed this one...first one by this author, now reading the next. It's a good read so far. I'll keep reading .
__label__2 Stunning page turner!: I absolutely could not put this book down. The twists and turns are myriad, the characterization is marvelous and the writing is excellent. Love the characters and the way their relationships tangle. Well done!
__label__2 First in the Forster series is great!: Lots of good courtroom drama and she keeps you guessing. The back story is very interesting with lots of twists and turns.
__label__1 Stopped reading: I know a few authors so my review is a meant as positive recommendation to Ms Forster in the hope that she can improve her craft. The story reads like it is aimed at teenagers and the plot is quite simplistic for this genre and very cliched. Character development is off the mark for a story like this and the writing and grammar needs attention also. This might appeal to some (as we can see by the positive reviews) but I couldn't get past about the first 20 pages. Sorry.
__label__2 Hostile Witness: Excellent book. First time I have read her books. Great mystery murder with unsuspecting ending. Not your typical "I know who did it" before reaching the end.
__label__2 very good: fast moving, good story line, I couldn't put it down and have already started the 2nd of this series. would recommend
__label__1 Boring: This seems more like the writing of a mildly talented high school student than a polished piece of writing. The composition is immature and strained. I found it boring, set it down, and doubt I will ever finish it.
__label__2 First thriller and I liked it: This was my first thriller and I enjoyed it very much. It kept me guessing the whole time. I usually pride myself in being able to predict movies and books..but this one gave me a run for my money (well, I got it for free but still) Was it Hannah? Was it Linda? Was it Kip? I couldn't tell until I read it. Overall a good read and I think I'll buy the other books because I want to know how Josie and Archer are doing and Josie's mom. Read this book/buy it!
__label__2 Enjoyed Hostile Witness: A little slow starting, but held my interest because of twisted suspense in the characters Looking forward to subsequent books by this author!
__label__2 Hostile Witness: A fast moving book that could be a true story!! I place this right up there with Patterson. I like a book that makes you not want to put it down and this is one of those
__label__2 Unable to put it down!: Hostile Witness is the first book in the 'Witness Series' that includes Silent Witness and Privileged Witness and is an impressive introduction to the key characters: Josie Baylor-Bates is the talented lawyer who takes on the impossible murder case, defending the very troubled teenager Hannah Sheraton. As the story unfolds you get caught up in the drama of the storyline as well as the underlying issues of mother/daughter relationships. The characters develop over the course of the three books. Start with this one and get them all.
__label__2 Hostile witness: Very fast reading. I would read from this author again. Did figure out early in the book who was guilty.
__label__2 Great view on people: I was not sure about this book when I first purchsed it. However, it did not take long getting to know the characters and burying yourself into the story. Rebecca Forster has a brilliant depth of knowledge on the human character and takes you inside each character. Now I am looking for other books by Mrs. Forster. Good reading but use caution as this book can and will make you late for work and other engagements as you keep turning the pages.
__label__2 A free book that was enjoyable: This was the first free book that I liked and enjoyed reading. I like arguments of lawyers and how their arguments change the judgement. I liked the legal arguments part of the book. Somethings were too good to be accepted as reality like the daughter loving her mom so much. Overall, I could not keep the book down and continued reading without a break.
__label__2 Legal thriller: Well written, kept my interest throughout. Ending was not a complete surprise yet was interesting to see how the events unfolded.
__label__2 I loved this book: This book was intense, gripping, and I could not put it down. I would recommend this book to anybody who loves legal thrillers like I do.
__label__2 Hostile Witness: Overall good storyline. Liked the flow of the book until the end where it just wrapped up too easily and fast. But it does leave you wondering about the girl and if she is guilty or innocent. I would recommend it to others. It's a good read.
__label__2 Filled with suspense: Rebecca Forster kept me in suspense for the whole read. Was very surprised at the ending. Forster knows how to keep your attention.
__label__2 great cd: This is a good Cd to buy. It has all of the great songs by Black Sabbath. But, no one can replace Ozzy, and Dio, just wasn't that good. If you listen you'll hear him in every song yealling "yeeeeeaaaaahhhhhh" or "oooooooohhhhh". He does it quite often too. It's like he doesn't want anyone to hear the music, just his voice. This is my opinion though.
__label__1 Alright For What It Is: Unfortunately when I bought this cd it wasn't through amazon and I was pretty computer illiterate, nowhere on the whole double cd does it say who sings and from the listing of songs I being 15 at the time and born in 81' of course having no clue about Sabbath having more than one singer assumeed it was Ozzy, I was sadly disapointed, I'm not much of a Dio or Rainbow fan love the words but just don't like his voice, but for those of you who love or even kinda like Dio you should definately get this one it's back in his hey-day with Sabbath behind him best Dio ever sounded, the songs are so good I had to give it 1 star even though I can't stand the singing.
__label__1 Ridiculous! This is not Black Sabbath!: How can this be the Black Sabbath? Ozzy is not in the band anymore! Why can't the people get it into their heads, Black Sabbath cannot be Black Sabbath without Ozzy Osbourne; he is Sabbath's first singer and the one who made Black Sabbath the father of Heavy Metal! As for Dio, he shouldn't be singing Ozzy's songs as if like he made them, Ozzy made them!If you want real Black Sabbath albums, buy all their albums with Ozzy from their self titled album all the way to the Reunion album. Avoid any non-Ozzy Black Sabbath albums, they won't sound the same and won't be the same as the original Black Sabbath.
__label__2 About what I expected: I had hoped the book would answer some questions about the diet.It did. Has a decent listing of remedies for various illness.
__label__1 love the phones not the cord: Beware - this vendor does NOT include the original Sony extension cord. His has the much smaller male plug, (guess that's the 2.5mm label, as if I knew what that meant) along with a control that does nothing.
__label__2 Finally! comfortable headphones!: I've had these headphones for several months now, and love them. I find most earbud headphones are uncomfortable and easily fall out. Not these - I use the smallest covers (comes with 3 sizes) and they fit right in my ear and they don't fall out! The sound is much better than the basic over-the-head Sony headphones I've been using for years.My only complaint is with the cord - it's really short, and has an extension - which then makes it way too long. It's just awkward all around. The comfort and sound make it an easily overlooked problem, though.Overall, these are EXCELLENT headphones. A bargain for the price!
__label__1 poor construction: At first they were great. Great sound and even a cool little spool for shortening the line. Little disappointed at first because I didn't get a case with mine. Anyway, after a couple of weeks the insulation started wearing and wires were exposed. Sony is a trusted name and I'm truly disappointed at the poor quality. Save up your money and buy a good set of earphones that won't fall apart after a few weeks. Unfortunately for me, I lost my receipt and cannot return mine. Live and learn. Bad job, Sony!
__label__1 Worst deal. I bought headset and they send me bug buster: Pls do not buy any item from this vendor as they have sent me wrong item with correct receipt. in spite of mentioning them to refund the shipping charges, they have not returned the money. I had to pay for shipping and return charges from my pocket and tons of stress.
__label__1 Great for 3 month's use, then they fall apart.: I bought these to use with my MP3 player and used everyday on my commute to and from work (20 minutes each eay).Pros - the bud style keeps outside noise out very well, almost too much when walking around NYC. But the play back sound was very immpressive.Cons- the wire seemed to melt or eat itself in about 3 months. I alreayd have to replace them because of all the electrical type i have on them and the continued tearing. Also the connector for the extension cable is in an akward place. If i leave it off i have to rest the MP3 player in my front shirt pocket. it wont reach my pants w/o/ the extension. BUt, the extension is too long and I have to wrap it around the player to avoid excess slack. I am 6 feet tall if that helps.I would avid these based solely on the fact that they do not last normal wear and tear.
__label__1 The EX-70 had it right, why change it?: As a person who's been using the EX70s from the get go, I'm left wondering why sony decided to "fix" something that wasn't broken. Why in the hell would you give it an extension cord? Now, it weighs down one ear. The EX-70s sounded great, were light weight, and were always my go to ear buds.I was sorely disappointed with these because it totally reeks of some top brass saying they needed change for change sake.If I could still find the EX-70s, I'd still buy them, even with the fact that it craps out in one ear after about a year.
__label__2 Cheap, good sound - just keep 'em clean!: I love mine and have had them for two years now with no serious problems. I too, had what I thought was a dead set after a year, but I discovered otherwise.Reviewers that might have had problems with their Fontopias should check the buds for "blockage" and possibly reconsider/amp up their personal hygine. I found that it is easy for the tiny speaker hole to get dirt, wax, etc. in it making it seem like the earphone is dead. Careful cleaning fixed the problem for me, and occasional Q-tip use in the ol' ears helps keep the earbuds clean.These work great under a motorcycle helmet and you can still hear some outside noise if you keep the music down or off (say, while in the city/not on open country roads).
__label__2 I bought three!!!!: These have such great sound quality. After buying them, I bought two more as gifts and also recommended them to two others who ended up purchasing some for themselves. Great investment.
__label__1 Great sound, but very fragile: I love the Sony quality sound, but I've gone through about 4 pairs of these headphones in a year and stopped buying them. The spot where the two cords come together to become one is the weak spot, and anywhere from a few weeks to a few months you start noticing one side getting lower and lower til you can't hear it anymore. I think Sony has it right in the sound quality, but they need to rethink the construction so they don't break so easily.
__label__1 Sound great but flimsy. Will not last.: I tried the cheaper in ear noise cancelling Sony earphones and they broke in a very short amount of time. I figured the more expensive version would be more durable. I WAS WRONG. These broke in an even shorter amount of time - 2 weeks. $50 is a lot to spend on disposable headphones. I guess Sony makes all of their products disposable; portable CD-players, stereos, etc. Sony customer service also sucks. Pray you'll never have to deal with them. Better yet, just don't buy Sony and go with Shure. It is more but worth it because it will last. Buy from a company that doesn't believe in disposable products.
__label__2 Sound Great w My Ipod: I am listening to these right now and they sound great. I do not find any problem with the EQ or bass response at all. Most importantly for me, they fit in my ears and stay there. I must have a different ear shape versus the general population because my Ipod ear buds fall right out. These fit in the ear, block out the rest of the world and bring out music that I have never heard before. They include a very short chord and an extension. I only wish that the chord was about 6 inches longer. It must be designed to connect to an MP3 player worn on the arm but a few more inches before needing to add the extenstion would have helped. They also include a small carrying case and an even smaller case that the ear pieces fit into to stop tangling and - best of all - it actually works!
__label__1 Fragile!: I liked these headphones a lot. But after just a few months, the right ear stopped working. And don't even try to get support from Sony. They send out irrelevant form letters in response to your query.
__label__1 Perfect...Until they broke: so i bought these for $50 bucks. i was amazed...good bass good highs but when there were too many sounds going on like in Halo...they got this cracked distorted sound. o by the way, the people complaining about the bass response clearly didn't read the instructions. they stated "earphones must have right size and must fit snuggly in ear or bass response may be lost" basicaly it means choose the right size or there will be no base at all. i got perfect base. one problem is the sound containment on the outside was horrible, i got continually nagged to turn it down to the point where i couldnt hear it. then not even 6 months later...they broke! the left earbud went dead for no reason at all. no earwax in the mesh or anything. im mad cuz i wasted $50 bucks for a broken product. BUY THIS PRODUCT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! IM GOING BACK TO THE APPLE EARBUDS!
__label__1 short life: This is a nice headphone. I purchase it twice in my life, but will never buy it again. The first one stopped working after 2 months. It was still under the three months of warranty, and so I exhanged for a new one for free (except the shipping cost). The exchanged one last a little longer, almost half a year. Since I really like the headphone, I purchased a new one. This time, it stopped working one week after 3 months. The repair cost is $29, and therefore if I really want it, I'd better buy a new one instead of repair. I always take good care of the headphone, and I am not a heavy user. I really would not recommend it unless you are willing to spend $28 every 3 months.
__label__1 Good for music, bad for exercising: I was looking forward to a great pair of earphones that I could take to the gym...and while they're great on the subway, these STINK on the treadmill. A little bit of sweat is all you need for them to pop out of your ears, and once that happens, you're out of luck.
__label__2 Great sound, Great Bass, Great Price: I'm not much of a 'go out and buy and test everything' type of guy. I'm more of the 'read all of the reviews and select the best product for the best price' type. I did such with these headphones and it was well worth it. These are great for noise cancellation and awesome sound. I work as an engineer on my computer sitting on a factory floor and when I have these on I can't hear anything but great sounding music with incredibly perfect bass inside of my head. It's like I'm creating the music right inside of my head. I would recommend these to anyone who doesn't know a whole lot about the whole spectrum of inner-ear head phones and doesn't care to. If you don't want to spend hardly anything and get an amazing sound this is your stop.AND! as an added bonus they come with a great carrying case.
__label__2 Love these Headphones: These headphones are a great bargain. Good sound quality and nice base. Plus they do a good job of blocking out other sounds. The only problem I have with them is over time the cable seems to deteriorate. But for the price you get a year out of them and then purchase another pair. I have three pairs of them. One I use for yard work, one when I exercise, and one for out and about. One item I really like is they have a shorter cord so if you use a arm band for your IPOD player or put the IPOD in your shirt pocket or chest pocket you have just the right length of cord. Though they give an extension section should you want a longer cord. They are in the ear design so if you don't like something pushed into your ear canal, you may not like these.
__label__1 Poor design, Good sound: I thought I purchased a defective pair and took it back to the store because the ends of the cords are UNEVEN. The right side is 1/4 shorter than the left. I put it on and the extra length is supposed to lie on the back of your shoulders. This is a little wierd for me because I am used to even cord lengths and my headphones forward.Otherwise the sound quality is very good, but the cord length is such a design flaw that I am already looking for another pair of headphones.
__label__2 Excellent reference--maybe two small improvements: Overall, this is an excellent resource for Bible study and getting a deeper, clearer understanding of God's word. The smaller size is nice for taking with you and fitting on a bookshelf. However, I am pretty much new to Word study. It would really be helpful to have a page or chapter explaining how to fully use this resource. This one volume is not alone, most books like it have the same shortcomings, they rarely tell you how to fully use the book. This is only a minor complaint. Also, as an "old guy", an even slightly larger font would have been really appreciated. I understand because of the restrictions of size the need to condense this as far as practical. It just makes study a little more difficult and tedious when the font is so small for some of us.However, for the most part I am completely satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone needing a concordance and word study book.
__label__1 Proctor Silex 22605 Toaster: Disappointing failure. This two-slice toaster broke after less than one month of use. Bread lifter would not stay down when pressed.
__label__1 can't pop up toast before it's done: Beware! Once you've selected the "shade" of how you want the toast, and depress the lever, the only way you can get it to stop earlier is to unplug it!! I hate that aspect. I keep my bread in the freezer, so it takes longer to toast. The first time I used it, I set it for too dark. The toast started burning. I tried pushing up on the lever like you would to most toasters, but nada! I had to unplug it to make it stop. Very poor design. Other than that, I like it. It's not only wide enough for bagels, but long enough for Branola or Orowheat bread, which not alltoasters are. I plug this into a surge surpressor now, so if it needs to come out early, I trip the surpressor, and the toast pops up.
__label__1 Garbage. look elsewhere: We got this in the spring of last year, based on the strength of the reviews. It has already failed. Whatever mechanism is designed to hold the toast down no longer does so. We can merrily clamp it down manually, but that's not really too fun.
__label__1 junk: a piece of junk! you have to unplug the toaster to getthe toast to pop-up. certainly not a quality product
__label__1 disapointed: Does not evenly toast. Very cheap looking and shoddy preforming product. Would NOT purchase another Proctor Silex toaster or other product.
__label__2 Meets expectations: Great product! Perfect size and very convenient to use. I would definitely recommend.
__label__2 It's smaller than it looks: This is a very small scale limited to 16oz (1lb). It works well and the hold feature is quite helpful when using a larger plate. My only frustration is the limit of 1lb since many of my plates already weigh 8-12oz or more.
__label__1 More Like Iommi Solo: I totally hated this album when it was first released, but have warmed up to some of it over the years. I think Tony Iommi wanted to bill this as a solo effort instead of a Sabbath release(he was all that was left of the band at this point)but Warner Brothers wouldn't go for it. A lot of it doesn't feel like a Sabbath album; it's an attempt to be way too commercial. Glenn Hughes is okay here;I really liked him as a member of Deep Purple. I will say that Seventh Star sounds a little more polished than the Born Again fiasco with Gillan.
__label__2 Excellent learning tool: I am a Montessori teacher in a 3-6 year old classroom. We studied the life cycle of butterflies this spring. We just released the butterflies that the children watched morph from caterpillar to butterfly. This puzzle was an excellent companion activity. The children choose this work (still) over and over again.
__label__2 Must Have for Avid Vegetable Gardeners: The previous reviewer who gave this one star because they were looking for info for alkaline soils should have their soil tested through their county extension service and amend their soil appropriately making the issue mute.This is a fantastic book full of information and techniques which result in a comprehensive "go to" reference which is far more thorough than most American vegetable gardening books. I've been gardening all my life, spend a lot of time seeking information online but always appreciate comprehensive references for my personal library. I highly recommend this book for it's content and credibility.
__label__1 Ms. Truman, could you please (...) ME instead?: I had to read this book for school. I don't know WHY. All the characters were identical, the plot was confusing, and the end had no real explanation whatsoever. It took me a MONTH to read this garbage. I think she's just riding on the wave of her Daddy's fame from his presidency and never actually bothered to take writing lessons.
__label__2 Like An Old Friend: I read this book about 30 years ago. It changed my life and helped set me on the path as a doctor of natural medicine. The advice is old standard practices and they WORK.With health care becoming more like 'Disease Care' I think anyone with a health challenge will find the answers they need.The book was delivered quickly and was in excellent condition. Opening the shipping box and seeing the cover was a lot like opening my front door and seeing an old friend.
__label__2 The Most "User Friendly" Guide I Have Found...: I have a 6 year old son with autism, he was diagnosed at the age of 3. In my quest for help, advice, and understanding of this complex disorder I have read just about everything out there. This one tops them all as the most "user friendly", hands down.Other books have left me feeling totally inadequate. This one gave me ideas I used the VERY DAY I read it!Superb blending of the authors' viewpoints -- one from the autism expert, the other from the "real expert" (the mother, of course!).Excellent chapter breakdown by autism challenges and symptoms. I was able to immediately flip to the chapter that was my biggest concern, and go from there.I am buying a copy for my son's Behavior Intervention Teacher, because there are so many terrific ideas we can integrate between school and home.I cannot say enough about this book -- if you have a child with autism, or if you work with a child with autism -- you MUST have this book!
__label__1 wow what a wierd movie: I love Dean Koontz and have all his books. The movie was wierd. Not like the book. I loved the book and it freaked me out. the movie was just wierd. The acting was not that good. It lacked conviction, passion and realism. Man, they sure could have done a lot better then the end result. Still movie was ok. The boy in the movie was sadly to say, poor acting. But then again, so where the adults, even the bugs were poor acting - lol. I gave it a 2 stars for effort. Unless you love Koontz and collect all his stuff, you may want to pass on this one. LOL.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE: I bought this movie and it was a waste of money. I'm serious. If your a Dean Koontz fan, stick with the books. His books are great but I seen some of his movies and they aren't so...um good.
__label__1 Looks like the right CD... but it's not: To see my comment, please check out the 1-star review that BlueNote wrote. I made a comment off his review about how the same thing happened to me. BEWARE!! The CD you receive will probably not be the one you ordered!!
__label__1 NOT a happy customer: I bought this as a gift for my parents and just found out [Dec. 25th] they need to also purchase a transmitter to get the darn thing to even work. The picture shows the transmitter- there is NO mention of requiring this piece as well. This information is necessary in order for someone to make an educated decision on whether or not to buy. What a slippery marketing tactic.
__label__1 Waste of a good start: Here is a story that just merely starts with a neat premise and very quickly meanders. The authors' attempt to explain the intricacies of Indian family, religion, and topography of Sri Lanka ( Probably Jaffna more likely Mullaitivu) are all consistently awful.It gets worse with two dimensional glum characters and recurring single dimensional characters (Just names)thrown in the middle of the unnecessary detours. The closest experience to this was trying to listen to my neighbour's kid playing the Alto sax. He sure did hit all the high notes but just missed the music part.
__label__1 inheritance: This book has to be the worst ya fiction ever. Unrealistic. Had to give it one star because you require it.
__label__1 Wireless Headphone: Maybe I just don't understand this wireless system. My husband and I purchased these because he watches TV in bed. He is hard of hearing and turns the volume up to the point it keeps me awake.But with this wireless headset we thought you would not have to hear the volume on the TV at all. Well that's not true. It says turn the source of the volume up instead of the headset so there is no hissing. Well you can still hear the hissing and the TV volume is still turned up loud.We adjusted the base and he is not far from it. He still has to have the volume on the TV turned up. I thought it was just him so I tried them and I had the same problem. TV had to be turned up loud and static was unbearable for my ears.SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THE WIRELESS HEADSET IF I CAN STILL HEAR THE TV?
__label__1 These are great if your intention is to keep your ears warm: Sound is horrible and when they do decide to work don't move an inch, turn your head and your in static city.
__label__1 Unacceptable background hiss: We used these for about 2 weeks before deciding to return them. At first, they were fine. But they suddenly developed a background hiss that almost blocked out the audio from the TV. This was while using them 6 feet from the transmitter in a dark room. We tried everything to make the hiss go away, to no avail. I would not recommend these.
__label__1 Poor sound from TV.: Tried to use this for listening to the TV. The sound quality was poor. Did'nt try to use it from the stereo system.
__label__1 Only get this if you don't like quality sound: Well, I had high hopes for this product. I should have known better. Basically, you get a lot of static no matter how you adjust the knobs. Nuff said. Always that background noise, no matter what. This will work if you are watching TV in bed and don't want to wake the wife, but forget any sense of realism if you want immersive sound in a gamer environment or quality live music. I returned my set after about 40 minutes out of the box. Plus, you have to really aim the IR transmitter perfectly just to get a decent signal, and it cuts out any time you move around or place your hand in front of your face. Much better to suffer the wire than to purchase this. Don't do it.
__label__1 Whats the BUZZ about t his product: There are two flaws with this product.1) The cradle/charging system is very hard to properly engage although the charging light lets you know when your 5 minutes of struggle has finally succeeded.2) The sound quality (volume and clarity, lack of static) is poor unless you spend al ot of time getting it adjusted just right -- between the controls on my new Sony Bravia LCD TV and those on the headset.I bought this product because I thought the IR transmitter would be compatable with the IR transmitter in my Toyota Sienna entertainment system, and I could use the extra headsets from there as well.I was absolutely right and indeed, they work with the Sony IR transmitter --- and I would say they produce a lot better sound quality than the rechargeable headsets that came with this transmitter.
__label__1 Review: I needed a block with a long shank and this lock work perfectly masters have been around for a long time have proved themselves quite well as described, shipped quickly, good to do business with.
__label__2 Great product: Love these for the race track. You can also wear them with a hat to keep the sun off your head and out of your eyes. Quality is great.
__label__1 clunky: I'm not exactly sure how the manufacture expects you to use this product on an airplane, as the stabilizing bar behind your head prevents you from leaning back into your seat.I bought this and the Aiwa noise cancelling headphones at the same time. The Koss headphones are going up on eBay.
__label__2 Is what it is: This is a nice casual ring. Bends easier than I would like, but I would purchase again.
__label__2 Marmot hoody: My husband likes this light weight but very warm jacket very much. Partly because of the hood, full zipper and the fact that it didn't have a large logo or graphic print on it.
__label__1 Well, ppl, where do I start? brb: This is truly an appalling piece of garbage. If you part with any of your hard earned on this then I certainly feel very sorry for you.Honestly, if you feel the need to read something written by a pre-schooler then go to your local creche.
__label__2 worth every penny: my daughter's h2 came with it but her h2 is black and looked great on it.mine is military color so i wasn't sure how it would lookand it is great
__label__1 The DVD from This publications: We ordered all three of their publications. Unfortunatley, 65% or more of the items were repeated on all three DVD. There was very little new from one to other DVD. However, whatever was given was useful.
__label__1 not worth it: wow, i have used up my bottles, took all the horse pills on time , watched my diet , lifted like a freak ...and ta da! nothing, i look the same maybe even smaller now then before i started using this product... the worse thing that muscletech does besides lying to u about the results is having the nereve to charge 60 bucks plus shipping for this garbage. Mr. juiceman himself jay cutler endorses this only because he is smart and takes there huge amout of money by endorsing it knowing he never has or ever will (roids) use any supplement from muscletech...save ur money ppl...work harder in the gym cause this will not help u gain any mass whatsoever
__label__2 Holy Hammerhead: I just put the Bostich PN100K though a weekend of hard framing work and I can't say enough good things about it. After a couple of days of use I can't imagine life without this tool. By the end of the first day I was driving nails better than I could have swinging a hammer and in a second it was done. If it needed one more blow to set it that was a piece of cake. I could write paragraphs on it but suffice it to say that unless I only have one or two nails to drive I'm using this nailer.
__label__2 Handy Item to add to toolbox: Bought last week on Amazon to finish 16x20 deck after banging index finger twice with a 16 oz hammer. I know how to nail, but enough is enough. This little baby does exactly what it says it does. I put down 350+ #10 galvanized nails into joist hangars and at least 100 3 inch nails and it didn't even flinch. Even squeezes in tight spaces, even with the thing weighing in over 2 lbs. I didn't get tired of holding it cause it just slaps them right in.
__label__1 Maui - Mile by Mile: The Emperor Has No Clothes: I love Maui. I have all the Maui guidebooks. I have property in Maui. So I had to get "Maui - Mile by Mile, 2nd edition, fully illustrated with over 150 photographs," with a nice glossy color cover.Helllllo... Once you get past the cover, all the pictures are black and white. To be more accurate, the pictures look like they came off a basement laser printer that's low on toner - complete with vertical stripes. Do you know what pictures of rainforests look like in black and white? Gray doormats. Sunsets look like the Hiroshima blast. Self-publishing is great, but shouldn't there be a disclaimer or something? Get Maui Revealed instead - Twice the information with color pictures.
__label__2 Single best road guide for Maui: This is the single best road guide for Maui. First heard of it on trip advisor - came highly recommended. Nothing compares to its coverage of the road to hana drive. The details available for each stop are great. There are also other interesting drives described inside detailing the eastern half of the island in full detail. The last chapter covers the rest.
__label__2 Laughing and learning? Is that possible?: Yes it is. From the dedication in the front to the glossary at the back I laughed my way through and learned from this marvellous book. "Dads, Toddlers and the Chicken Dance" was given to me as a present when my daughter was born 2 weeks ago and it opened my eyes to a lot of experiences that I am about to go through but hadn't really thought about before. Its no nonsense approach is refreshing and it is laced with humour that keeps you reading. I'm rushing off to get "So You're Going To Be A Dad" just to keep me laughing! (and to see what I've missed out on!)
__label__1 Never got it running: Help!This game installs then plays the intro then the screen goes blank! When I emailed them they said it does not run on an Intel chipset. I thought almost everyone had an intel chipset.We are running Windows Xp, this is not an old computer!My sons were very upset ,,,we are hpoefully sending it back!
__label__1 nickelodeon party blast,horrible game: this game was bought for my niece and son.installed the game and it constantly shuts off.screen flickers,you can't use the keyboard correctly and then it just shuts off.they say it won't work with intel chipsets,well i have a via chipset and amd processor.so i guess they're wrong there.i'm using an ati radeon 9700 pro card,amd athlon 2200+ so there is plenty of power.tried the latest via and ati drivers with no help at all.don't waste your money and thank god i only wasted 9.99 at target.i also tried to totally clean the registry of all traces and it doesn't help.even a fresh install of xp didn't help.so there you have it.one last thing,there are no patches to download and support is like talking to a brick wall,except the wall might be more helpfull cause you can at least smash the cd off it.
